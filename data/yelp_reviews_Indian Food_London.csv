10/10/2022,5 star rating,the most authentic Indian restaurant in London by far. Every dish we had was amazing and reminded me of my home country. Also the atmosphere and vibe is real special. I've gone countless times and have never had a bad meal of substandard service..
12/11/2022,5 star rating,"Wow wow wow.. A very memorable experience and service provided by ALEX at this location on 3rd of November. Alex was attentive and charming, he made sure that my friends and I were well taken care of for the evening. I happen to have a mango allergy but the manager was able to resolve that issue quickly with a special menu that was checked off by the chef with all the dishes that did not have Mango in it. I was grateful and very appreciative of such wonderful gesture and hope the restaurant continues to provide this caliber of service in our future visits. Marvelous time spent and would highly recommend this location to anyone who is visiting London. Thank you Alex! Food was also absolutely delicious, dare I say some of the best Indian cuisine I've had so far? Make reservations if you can to avoid the long long line outside."
11/11/2022,5 star rating,"After having owned the cookbook from Dishoom for a while, I was really excited to try the dishes straight from the origin. I made a reservation for one during lunch hours on a long layover I had in London. A reservation is definitely recommended, by the time I was leaving, there was a line outside. As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I was taken by the gorgeous interiors. You can tell that the decor was carefully picked out and the detailing of every element of the restaurant was beautiful. It's a lovely ambiance to have a meal in. When I sat down, they handed me this cute paper menu that looked like a newspaper. Since I was dining alone, I asked the waitress for her best recommendations. She gave me several options from the small plates, entrees, and breads/rices. I started with the house chai. Then I chose a small plate--the okra fries, an entree--the lamb chops, and a garlic naan to go with it. The chai came out first and that was so delicious; I had 3 glasses (btw, they refill the chai for free!). Then came the okra fries and wow. That was one of the best preparations of okra I've ever tasted. Then my lamb chops and garlic naan came, and if you come here, you HAVE to try the lamb chops. They were cooked to perfection and extremely delicious. The garlic naan I probably could have done without with this dish, it was a bit thin and less fluffy than I was expecting. Overall, I absolutely loved this restaurant. It is a place not to be missed. I look forward to coming back in the future to try more of their dishes."
29/10/2022,5 star rating,The line is always so long here--so get here early. I got in at 6pm on a Friday and waited for about an hour. The food here is amazing! Especially the daal! It's so rich and creamy. The ruby chicken and the vegetable dish that came with buns were great too! It's absolutely worth the wait
14/10/2022,5 star rating,"4.5/5 stars As someone who isn't well versed in Indian food, the menu can be overwhelming. Our waiter was kind enough to explain that the dishes were meant to be shared, and he made recommendations for what dishes would be good. We got a few small plates: the Pau Bhaji (Mashed vegetables with buns) and the lamb samosa. Both of these were excellent. The lamb samosa was so crispy, hot, and flavorful. The Pau Bhaji was new for me. The bun was so fluffy and buttery and was perfect with the mashed vegetables. It just tasted like a herb/spice sauce. For our main entrees, we got the chicken berry biryani (chicken and rice dish) and the mutton pepper fry (curry dish) and added the raita (yogurt sauce). The chicken biryani was quite good, and the chicken was pretty tender. The raita was supposed to be used with the biryani, but it kinda made the dish too cold for my liking. The mutton pepper fry was tender and flavorful! It was spicy, but I was surprisingly able to tolerate it. We ordered garlic naan, which was perfect for scooping all the sauce. It didn't have a strong garlic flavor, and it wasn't piping hot. We also ordered the chili broccoli salad, which was divine! The combination of pistachios, seeds, and dates made the broccoli so tasty! Overall, I enjoyed our meal here and loved trying new foods! We came around 5:15 pm and didn't need to wait for a table, but when we left the restaurant, there was a huge line, so definitely try to go during off peak hours."
27/9/2022,5 star rating,"Food 5/5 Ambiance 5/5 Service 5/5 You'll likely have to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour for a table depending on the timing and your group size, but it's well worth it. They will sometimes pass out drinks to those waiting in line which is a nice touch. The food is stellar, though a bit different from your typical Indian restaurant in that it's more of a small plates style. Since portions are smaller, they recommend at least 2-3 plates per person here. My favorite was the Dishoom House Chaat, a dish that was recommended by our waiter. Note that unlike other Indian restaurants, they don't ask you for a preferred spice level on their dishes, so if you're particularly sensitive to spice, ask your waiter for specific recommendations. Ambiance is lively and there are neat booths downstairs where you can control the music level and (if I remember correctly) the fan as well- something I haven't seen at another restaurant. Bathrooms are also quite nice and clean- something that is always hugely appreciated in a big city like London. I will be making this a regular spot for anytime I'm in London!"
26/9/2022,5 star rating,"It is a chain restaurant but nothing about it lacks the quality. This place is incredible and they need to come to the States! Its Indian cuisines and its has a wide array of options. I feel like this is perfect for people that might be intimidated by Indian food and want to try it for the first time. Theres so much great choices for various diets: vegetarians, vegans, carnivores, etc. My partner is a vegan and she was pleased with all the options. I went with the Ruby Chicken which is essentially a tika masala chicken. Run don't walk to get it. Very delicious and the sauce with some basmati rice is outstanding. The samosas are a great appetizer as well. The gunpowder potatoes was a great side. Never had potatoes that seasoned before. Disroom please please please make your way to New York. They longing for a restaurant like this."
25/10/2022,5 star rating,The food was sooo amazing I forgot to take pictures before I ate it all. Dishoom is an absolute must if you are in london. Make sure you make a reservation or else you will have a wait!!! The ambiance is so nice and the staff is super attentive. The Ruby chicken was amazing. The tandoori chicken was juicy with just the right amount of charcoal grill. The garlic naan was perfect to dip in the sauce. Ugh- I will forever dream about this meal!!!
10/9/2022,5 star rating,"Came here for an early lunch when passing through the UK a while back and wow...the best indian food I have eaten out at a restaurant!! I generally don't eat indian food out because my parents are amazing cooks and we can enjoy good food from the comfort of our home most times. Before I came to the UK, numerous people raved about Dishoom telling me it was a must go! We had a quick stopover in the UK and made it a priority to come here! One thing to note is that they have breakfast hours where they serve a completely different menu from the regular lunch/dinner food. We had showed up early and they were still serving brunch. Call and check this in advance because we ended up waiting over an hour in the restaurant to get lunch food! Nonetheless, the wait was worth it! The ambiance of this spot it really pleasant and unique. We were treated so wonderfully by the staff and service was quite quick once lunch opened. We ordered a few different entrees -- chili chicken, chicken, daal, chicken tikka, and naan. We also got a mango lassi and rice on the side. The food was amazing! Flavors were solid, and meat was tender. I highly recommend all the dishes we ordered because I would 100% order them all again."
28/10/2022,5 star rating,"Allergy friendly restaurant - They went above and beyond to accommodate our allergies and dietary restrictions. There's a separate vegan menu. I received a binder of allergen matrix (excel sheets) to cross reference against allergens and menu items. The chef also marked up a menu for me, crossing out and checking off items that I can(not) have. I wish every place was like this! Our server was also patient and amazing! House chai - Subtly sweet with a strong ginger taste. Love it! My friend tried mine and ended up getting her own for dessert. Chicken ruby with garlic naan - Similar to butter chicken and absolutely delicious! There's a lot of chicken for the small dish. Garlic naan wasn't anything special, could be more garlicky. Murgh Malai - Perfectly seasoned and tender chicken dish but not particularly special. Chicken Berry Britannia - Delicious and definitely would get again! Chef's Covent Garden Special: Tila-Foi's Very Best Masala Fish - Very spicy, and too spicy for me, so it's hard to tell if it's good. Dishoom House Chaat - Delicious! Kind of get the flavors of a Vietnamese Spring Roll. Roti - Nothing special Mango kulfi - Disappointing in presentation. It's just a mango popsicle on a chopstick in a glass cup. Kala Khatta Gola Ice - Very strong on the spice side rather than sweetness. It was not a favorite. We had reservations for a party of 6, booked 1-2 months ahead. We noticed the non-reservation line was down the street!"
20/10/2022,5 star rating,"I had to come back to Dishoom. The wait was about 45mins and and they were so kind to be handing out chai and wine. Our waiter was so nice and explained the menu. The food was sooo good! The naan was extra soft. The drinks were strong, as they should be  I will definitely be coming back. This location is convenient and close to bars/pubs and the theater."
7/11/2022,2 star rating,"We got to Soho and there was a long wait to get in this restaurant. I was so excited because I wanted to know if the hype of it all was represented in the food. When we went in I smelled all the aroma of something great as far as Indian food. Everyone seem to be having such a great time and the Decor was just very eclectic and homey. I will say everyone who worked there was super nice and the service was great. However, I did not like the food. I looked around and there was another couple at the other table across from us and it didn't appear that they liked the food either. We ordered the samosas and they were tiny and crunchy and not like a regular Samosa at all. Didn't like these and wouldn't order these again. I also ordered the butter chicken and I was not a fan of the butter chicken, it had another name on the menu but basically this is what it was...The chicken was fatty and had some skin on it and the sauce was gritty almost pasty. My friend got the lamb chops and they were over cooked. There was an OK flavor there but when you over cook lamb chops that is kind of a terrible thing. I got a drink and the drink was OK but nothing to write home about. The garlic naan was gross. It didn't have a garlic flavor at all.I think the atmosphere here  was far better than the food. My experience at another Indian restaurant here was far better than Dishoom."
19/8/2022,5 star rating,"On a visit to London, we stopped by Dishoom as it was highly recommended on the internet.  They have indoor and outdoor seating as of this review, and also free wifi.  The restaurant has two levels, and has gorgeous decor.  We were able to walk in and get seated immediately on a Friday late afternoon. We had the mango lassi:  nice yogurty mango drink.  Not too sweet, and topped with fennel seeds.  Not sure what the fennel seeds were for except decoration as it wasn't very edible.  Still very good, 4/5  Basmati rice: a bit dry but still edible.   3/5 Chicken berry britannia: oddly has cranberries in it.  Lots of chicken in it. 4.5/5 Chicken ruby:  creamy and rich with a nice hint of ginger.  4.5/5 Garlic naan: thin and crispy, dotted with lots of fresh garlic and made by hand.  Highly recommend! 5/5 Lamb samosas: wish they were bigger; they were tiny!  Thin crispy outer layer.  4.5/5 All in all, this place was pretty packed for a reason.  Great comfort food, very salty though."
3/10/2022,5 star rating,"Just fabulous from the setting to the instructive service to of course food and drink. Two fun non alcohol cocktails I enjoyed the sober Negroni with my spicy mutton. While it is deceptively large restaurant, there were still ques to get in right after opening."
22/7/2022,4 star rating,"Finally tried the famous Dishoom on a recent trip to London. I was prepared for a long line for dinner and I think in total it took about 45 minutes for my party of 1. While in line the passed out samples of their chai which was a great way to get ready for the meal. I was seated in the back courtyard which was perfect though I will say the action seems to be downstairs with hustle and bustle. For my meal I got the vegetable samosas (phenomenal!), garlic naan, and the chicken ruby. There were so many options to choose from I would've liked to split a few things with friends to really get a sampling. Overall a nice experience!"
11/8/2022,4 star rating,"Heard many raving reviews about this place and had to wait 30 mins to get a spot; it was solid but maybe didn't quite live up to the hype. The waiter recommended we each pick 3 items. I got the murgh malai, roomali roti, and kachumber. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the roti was warm and yummy. Overall a solid choice!"
2/8/2022,5 star rating,"Dishoom !!! Yes the wait is worth it. We love eating at this Indian institution whenever we crave for this cuisine. Plates and drinks are solid! This time we had : CHAI- jeeeezus, it's the best ever! 5 stars OKRA FRIES - Fine lady's fingers for the fingers. (V) 5.90. 5 stars PAU BHAJI -A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot, buttered, home-made buns, Chowpatty style. . (V) (S) 6.10 3 1/2 stars HOUSE BLACK DAAL- A Dishoom signature dish - dark, rich, deeply flavoured. It is cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony. (V) 7.90 3 1/2 stars DISHOOM HOUSE CHAAT- Warm-cold, sweet-tangy, moreish. Golden-fried sweet potato covered with cool yoghurt, pomegranate, beetroot, radish and carrot. Tamarind drizzle and green chutney lift it nicely. (V) 6.90 5 stars Soooo good! DISHOOM CHICKEN TIKKA- A family recipe, using a marinade of sweet vinegar, not yoghurt. Laced with ginger, turmeric, garlic and green chilli. (S) 10.70 4  1/3 stars GUNPOWDER POTATOES- The seduction is in the tumble. New potatoes are smoky-grilled, broken apart, tossed with butter, crushed aromatic seeds and green herbs. (V) 6.90 (4 stars) SPICY LAMB CHOPS- Two chops of generous proportions. They lie overnight in a special marinade of lime juice, warm dark spices, ginger and garlic. Served pink, for juiciness, and blackened by the grill.

A pot is to be shared, or kept as spicy contentment all for oneself. CHICKEN BERRY BRITANNIA Tempting and flavourful pot of chicken, ginger, garlic, mint, coriander and rice cooked together in the Kacchi style. An homage to Britannia's Chicken Berry Pulao, with cranberries. 13.90. 4 stars LAMB BIRYANI -NALLI NIHARI BIRYA Nihari - a famously hearty and robust dish made with tender shank of lamb layered with rice and caramelised onions ! This is a clear winner on the table ! (5 stars )get this!"
12/8/2022,4 star rating,"Dishoom came highly recommended by a friend. I didn't make a reservation because I figured it would be quick for a single person to get seated but I was wrong, it was still 30+ minute wait standing in line in the heat. The cocktails were delicious! I had the Fizz and the Cabana Colada which was amazing. The food was good but I think I set the bar too high. I got the veggie samosas which were good but nothing out of this world and I got the Veggie mash dish which came with a side of a roll. I would have preferred if it came with a side of Naan. I ordered that separately which was very tasty."
11/7/2022,5 star rating,"Came by for breakfast the other morning and it was a world class experience. Made a reservation for a table and my table was ready upon arrival. The dining room seemed to be split up into 3 sections, the lower level, the street level, along with an outdoor-esque area on the street level. The décor of the dining room felt like time travel to India with the smell of some incense? as well when entering. Waiter was fantastic guiding me through the menu. Started off with the bottomless chai and it was excellent. Very fragrant and strong. Had the wrestler's naan for breakfast and it was world class. The naan was super fresh and fluffy. The eggs were cooked to perfection, super thick egg whites and solid orange yolk. The bacon was cooked to perfection without being super salty and the sausage was also excellent without being too salty! Portions were generous too! They have free Wifi. £16 for breakfast after service and GST."
14/7/2022,4 star rating,"**July 2022: Friday Afternoon Visit** My friend and I had multiple friends who stated that Dishoom was a must stop and by sheer luck we noticed that this Dishoom was along our route from the British Museum to the Palace Theater. At noon we walked in and were taken downstairs to their enormous seating area. That wasn't the case when my friend and I walked back from the theater (there was a line that wrapped around the building for the dinner rush - 6pm ish) If I were to describe Dishoom it's like a very trendy upscale Indian Restaurant that sort of gives me Cheesecake Factory feels (in terms of it's grandness and over the top space and atmosphere). After reviewing the extensive menu we decided on the following to share. Meal Pau Bhahi £5.90: Bowl of Mashed Vegetables with Hot Butter, homemade buns - I loved this as a starter! The buns were luxurious and buttery and a great way to pile on the veggie spread. Chicken Ruby £13.50: Tastes like Chicken Tikki Marsala - Solid and I would order this again.     Garlic Naan £3.90: It was okay, not as light and fluffy as I've had at other places, but I still used it to dip into the various curries Tandoori Roti £3.50: Didn't care for it. I'd pass Black Daal £7.50: I think this is a very hearty lentil curry. It's quite filling but among the three curry dishes this was my least favorite - not that it was bad, but the others were more of my taste. I think if I were to do this again I'd take this out of my order.   They charge an automatic 12.50 service charge (tip) Summary Overall, it's a very nice UK chain restaurant to visit. It's comfortable, well lit, accessible and classy."
4/8/2022,3 star rating,"House chaat 8.65/10- sweet potato with the crisps was a great texture and flavor. Really enjoyed how they had chutney included House chai 7.32/10- it was okay, not as much of a chai flavor as expected. Way too hot when it first came out Masala fish 7.34/10- this was good, very spicy but flavorful but only due to the spices tbh. The fish was huge also Kebab 5.64/10- good however could use a lot more flavor and was also kind of small. The onions in compliments added a lot to the kebab Chicken 7.32/10- this was really good and juicy however it was also a bit bland, wish it had more spice to it Basmati rice 7.43/10- pretty average rice"
20/7/2022,4 star rating,"Chocolate chai 6.87/10- so delicious! Great blend of ginger, cinnamon, and chocolate. Served warm only. Only tasted like a mix of chai and Cadbury hot chocolate. wasn't a huge fan of the cocoa powder on top only because it made me cough a lot Basmati rice 4.32/10- tastes like regular basmati rice but honestly I thought it would have a bit more flavor as I'm normally used to basmati rice having a bit more Ruby chicken curry 8.12/10- sauce is very sweet and creamy; The pieces of chicken are very tender however I wish they had more chicken pieces in the curry although they are big and juicy. Pretty strong taste of ginger also Garlic naan 5.23/10- not as fluffy as I was hoping. Honestly a bit bland and too crispy. Was hoping for a more buttered and garlic naan than what was received. Great accompaniment for the curry and rice but I think I would try their roti next time! Okra fries 8.27/10- very crispy and the masala taste was delicious! Could taste the ginger and garlic paste which complemented the chewy okra well. Served warm and was very comforting. Really enjoyed it with all three sauces: green chutney, spicy red masala, and a sweet brown sauce Lemon soda 8.73/10- wait this was so good they gave it to us while waiting in line. Literally so refreshing and not too carbonated. Perfect for this heat wave Kheer 6.84/10- the top was carmelized sugar which I really liked because it reminded me of crème brûlée and  gave the dessert a brown sugar/custard taste to it which was great. The actually Kheer did not have as much flavor as I was hoping by itself minus the top layer. They also had a blueberry topping on it which I found interesting and a bit out of place, although tasty.. This is considered to be London's best Indian restaurant and according to many, London's best restaurant. The line is always very long roughly 30-40 people. Will definitely have to come back, looking forward to trying a few of their other specialty dishes"
15/9/2022,5 star rating,"Decided to come try out Dishoom while on a trip to London since it was one the ""must-try"" Indian restaurants in the city. We went to Covent Garden location as it was close to the area we were exploring. There was a long line to get in but it went by pretty past and they even served us House Chai while we waited which tasted great! I tried the Chicken Ruby with garlic naan. I asked the waiter for a dish similar to Butter Chicken and she mentioned that the Chicken Ruby was basically the same thing. While I enjoyed the dish, it did not taste like butter chicken and was actually very different. Forgot the name of the drink I got but it was delicious!"
21/6/2022,5 star rating,"WOW!!! If it is your final night in London, do not leave without dining at Dishoom. * Spicy Lamb Chops * Chicken Ruby * Raita * Kachumber * Garlic Naan * Peacock Cider Every single item we ordered was outstanding!!!! Everything. The cider included. The lamb chops stole the show. Thick, succulent, herb-spiced. I have never had lamb chops like this before. Even our waiter said these were his top 3 chops he has ever had. I would agree. You will want to eat all of the meat to the bone. The Chicken Ruby, their name for ""curry""  has tender, succulent chunks of chicken that has been marinated for 24+ hours in a nutty, butter sauce. There are no nuts (my friend is allergic) but the flavor is hearty and earthy. So good! Raita could have been a little thicker but the flavor made up for that. Kachumber reminded me of a greek salad but with cilantro (coriander) and green chili peppers. The lime brings a balances the dish and cuts the spice from the chili pepper nicely. While I have had better garlic Naan, it was not a disappointment. I washed everything down with a glass of Peacock Cider and hope to be able to find it back in the states. Beautiful interior decor that is modern, and stylish without being flashy. Perfect for a date or a night out with friends. On my next visit to London I will absolutely return to Dishoom."
20/6/2022,5 star rating,"Indian Flavors From Bombay with Love is Dishoom's signature phrase and with multiple locations in London, it's clear that Dishoom is a hit with locals and visitors alike Indian cuisine is the most cited must-try cuisines in London and I was glad we made reservations to Dishoom's Covent Garden location Lines were out the door our whole meal and reached 1.5 hours long and Dishoom has been on the scene for several years Their winning formula includes accessible dishes, stellar flavors, creative drinks and shareable plates perfect for big and small groups alike I enjoyed my dinner so much that I returned the next morning to try their signature breakfast naan and it was definitely a trip highlight Wrestler's Naan (Peppery Bacon, Sausage and Runny Yolked Egg) £10.50 / Prawn Koliwada £8.50 / Okra Fries £5.70 / Chicken Ruby £13.50 / Spicy Lamb Chops £15.90 / Gunpowder Potatoes £6.90 / Tila-Foi's Very Best Masala Fish £18.50 / House Black Daal £7.50 / Roomali Roti £3.50 / Mango & Fennel Lassi £4.40 / Rose & Cardamon Lassi £4.40 / Mango Kulfi £4.50 Dishoom Covent Garden (London, United Kingdom) Dishoom accepts credit cards and is mainly indoor dining with a small section of patio."
14/6/2022,5 star rating,"This Indian restaurant chain, is one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to in all my travels... They have various locations throughout London.  we dined in Covent gardens very popular area, people love this restaurant we waited an hour for our table but, it was well worth it ...the tikka chicken was delicious the prawns , the sweet potato with yogurt and pomegranate seeds so flavorful.  we had a little bit of everything and then for dessert... yum!  we had the warm dark chocolate pudding and one of their ice cream pistachio Kulfi( basically ice cream on a stick) but so delicious. I wish I could package this restaurant up and take it back to the states with me... i'll be back in three weeks and you can better believe I will make my reservation now..."
8/6/2022,5 star rating,"THIS INDIAN FOOD, WOW!! I had 3 traveller friends recommend this restaurant so I knew I had to try it! There was a long line out the door, but wait time was only 30 minutes. The girl doing check ins was told my MIL injured her leg, so she and my FIL were allowed to sit at the bar to relax until a table became ready. So considerate! We enjoyed every bite of our food. We ordered: Rose lassi (unique) Chaat Gunpowder potatoes Ruby chicken Matter paneer Vegetarian biryani (unique) Desserts: kneer (has blueberry in it) and chili brownie and ice cream (unique) The service was knowledgeable and attentive. I wish I could try everything off their menu! If I'm ever back in the London area I'll be back for more!"
16/9/2022,4 star rating,"We went here with a friend and had a great time.  The line is pretty ridiculous, but it moved quickly, and I appreciated that they brought refreshing drinks out to us while we waited.  Inside, it was packed and lively.   The food was great.  We definitely over ordered.  The most surprising thing was a dish with jackfruit.  Not surprising was that their famous black daal was fantastic.  Worth the line."
1/7/2022,5 star rating,"The line in Convent Garden at around 9 pm only took us 45 minutes, way better than their busiest location near Carnaby if I may say. This is also a newer and bigger location so the ambience is amazing. We ordered the chicken ruby, chicken berry biryani, veggie samosas, and garlic naan. Everything was amazing!! It was worth the wait and hype. 5/5."
30/10/2022,4 star rating,"Great indian fusion restaurant Not for the ones that looks for the authentic tase of India, but extremely good"
7/8/2022,4 star rating,"When I was in London a month prior, I had been unable to get a reservation at Dishoom and the line to get in was down the block. I made a point to make a reservation for my return trip, and even a few weeks out could only get a very late lunch or very early dinner reservation. This probably is somewhere it's better to come with a group so that you can try different things, but as a solo traveler I had the: CHEF'S COVENT GARDEN SPECIAL (TILA-FOI'S VERY BEST MASALA FISH) Aunty-ji's recipe, refined over decades with love. Two fillets of sea bream marinated in Tila-foi's masala with ginger-garlic, black pepper, lime juice, carrom seeds and red chilli. Griddled within a banana leaf and served to share. Eat with companionable Coconut Chaas. It says served to share but I definitely ate the whole thing myself. It was very flavorful and to the disappointment of the server, I did not eat it with the Coconut Chaas, but rather, plain. I found that there were so many spices and flavors in the fish that I did not want to drown it in a yogurt/sauce. I would love to try some of their more ""traditional"" dishes (that you would find on the menu at other Indian restaurants) so that I could do a comparison, but at the same time, why get something that you can get anywhere. I suppose this is why you need to come with a group (if you can get a reservation!). All in all I had a great experience here but am not sure that I'd wait in a long line (very good, but not amazing)."
21/8/2022,5 star rating,"Always the best food! I have always gone to Dishoom for dinner. On a recent trip to London, I was able to get there for brunch before leaving for the airport. Like everything else, the naan roll hit the spot. If I lived in London, I'd be here every week. Also shoutout to the chai...it's yummy!"
1/8/2022,5 star rating,"One of the best and most consistently great restaurants in London.  This is one of my regular go-to's and somewhere I like take people who are coming from out of town.  There are multiple locations each with a slightly different ambiance but the food is always good at each of them. My typical order includes the following: Prawn koliwada: This is a great starter that comes in a cute bowl filled with succulent prawns that come with some heat.  They are slightly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.  They pair well with any of the sauces and chutneys they bring to your table.  I like to mix the spicy and mild together (orange/red and green sauces) Garlic cheese naan: I mean, is there a better combination? The naan has a great cheese pull and is filled with chilli's for a perfect light kick.   Chicken tikka: no, this isn't chicken tikka masala.  This is grilled chicken thighs with some lovely seasoning and comes with a coriander (cilantro) and red onion garnish.  Simple but executed well 24 hour daal: do yourself a favour and order this.  These lentils have been stewing away for 24 hours and are a great component with your meal.  Creamy texture and flavourful, quite comforting.   Chilli chicken: my second favorite small dish.  This chicken packs quite some spice but it's a can't miss dish.  The chicken is crunchy and gently coated with a chilli sauce that isn't overbearing in terms off the amount.   So, you want to dine here? They only take reservations for larger groups which means you have to queue (wait in line) but it's absolutely worth it.  You can put your name in and grab a nice drink from the bar but do expect at least an hour wait so you can factor that in to when you arrive.   Happy eating!"
18/10/2022,3 star rating,"I was in London for 6 days and came twice to this restaurant. This speaks volumes for their food. The stars off are not for the food. The wait is 30 to 45 minutes, so be prepared. The food is outstanding - chicken tikka masala, mutton ruby, jackfruit biryani, garlic naan. 1 star off - Service is mixed. They are not as attentive, which is understandable as the restaurant is huge. 1 star off - They use this ridiculous QR code for payment and don't accept cash. This is unfortunate if you don't want to enter your credit card information through their website."
13/10/2022,4 star rating,"finally got to try dishoom which had been the top of my list for a while! id heard raving reviews so my expectations were high but first, context: i am a student in a budget and was dining with just another broke student, so price was a consideration. thus we had to choose our dishes wisely - vegetable samosa: 3/5. the taste was standard, but quite small. i expected maybe two samosas but each large, instead of four small ones. - the masala fish chef's special: 5/5. god, the star of the show. it was unique, wrapped in a bamboo leaf, packed with flavor and slightly crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. paired very nicely with the coconut chaas, which i LOVED (tasted like strawberry yogurt) - bowl of greens: 3/5. i mean, its just broccoli and snow peas, but they did the job of serving as a break from the savoriness - chicken tikka: 4/5. we ordered this after realizing that what we got was not enough. in terms of price, this was the best value. the chicken was tender and, though it is plain in color, PACKED with lots of spice, so have water ready. came with a side of red onion and parsley. overall service was a 5/5: our waitress was sweet and came to check on us several times but not in an annoying way. also the payment system is v high tech!"
31/8/2022,5 star rating,"Fresh, bursting flavors. Service and atmosphere exceptional. Okra, Ruby Chicken and Tikka chicken all exceptional. We never felt rushed, staff is fantastic!"
12/10/2022,3 star rating,"Nice restaurant but the food was a little underwhelming. We ordered a variety of dishes and everything was just okay. The menu is big and there are a lot of nice options. The service was great and the atmosphere was cool and dark. Overall, I am glad we tried but would maybe try the breakfast next time."
7/5/2022,5 star rating,"Dishoom is a London staple and one of the most must-try restaurants in the city. Come order delicious Bombay cuisine off the large, newspaper-styled menu while enjoying a casual, Indian summer breeze kind of vibe. My favorites are the house black daal (rich and complex flavors!), the chicken ruby, and the mutton pepper fry. The prawn koliwada also makes a nice appetizer, and the roti is great for dipping and soaking up various saucy dishes. If you come before noon, you can enjoy their fabulous breakfast instead. The Big Bombay has everything savory you could want, including scrumptious akuri (like spicy scrambled eggs) and masala beans. Meanwhile, if you want something sweet, go for the uttapam stack: pancake-like, topped with creamy-yet-fluffy, sweet-yet-slightly-tangy whipped yogurt and berries. Enjoy it all with the bottomless house chai. There are multiple locations, but this one in Covent Garden is my favorite for being casual yet comfortable and very spacious. There's often a line, but it moves quickly (e.g., less than 30 minutes -- and they'll bring complementary chai and mint tea while you wait!). Overall an excellent choice for tourists or locals alike!"
7/11/2022,5 star rating,"Loud, crowded and absolutely fun! Food was tasty and service smooth Decor is worth going there for"
9/7/2022,5 star rating,"One of the best meals I had in London. I would go back every single time. The food is delicious, the decor is amazing, and the servers know what they're talking about! There's plenty of seating so if you see a queue don't fret! It moves very quickly!!"
2/3/2022,4 star rating,"Been wanting to try out Dishoom for the longest time as it is the most reviewed place in London, insane considering there are other world-famous landmarks like the Big Ben and the British Museum. Made a reservation online and was seated promptly in a cute dome-shaped booth. - Chicken Ruby - This is essentially butter chicken and I really enjoyed the flavor which had hints of ginger in it. The chicken was also very tender and flavorful. My one complaint though is that the dish didn't come with naan or rice and this is given that you know, so you do have to order an extra side in order for the main dish to not be so salty. - Garlic Naan - Good relief from the saltiness of the chicken ruby. To be honest, you couldn't really taste the garlic bit of it, so I wouldn't say you have to order the garlic flavored naan. Overall, pretty solid Indian place. Not sure if it lives up to the hype of being the most reviewed place in London but the food was all-around very good. My other only complaint is that it was my friend's birthday and they gave us a dessert to celebrate with a candle. The dessert was good but it was not free which is what it usually is in America, so that was a bit disappointing but now I know."
15/4/2022,4 star rating,"Stopped by on a busy Friday evening - the wait was around 40 mins. Got to enjoy some complementary excellent cups of chai and some sherry while waiting in line which only made me hungrier and ready to sink my teeth into some delicious food. Our server was attentive and friendly and made some excellent recommendations and helped us navigate the menu. From the grill section, we ordered the murgh malai and spicy lamb chops - both succulent and well marinated. Didn't love the ruby chicken gravy - too tomato-EY for my taste but did appreciate how juicy and delicious the chicken was in it. The garlic naan was . The shrimp was a fun dish to try out as well - crispy and spicy. For the drinks, I tried (and loved) the 1948 sour. My husband had the India gimlet, which he enjoyed as well. For dessert, we tried the kala khata gola, which was an interesting, albeit inauthentic version of the traditional."
5/9/2022,5 star rating,Awesome food !!!!!! Reasonable price! Service and ambience - excellent Chai tea was pretty good too (not sure why people hype about it tbh. But I mean it's okay) Chicken Tikka with garlic naan are a must try !
7/11/2022,5 star rating,"Waited about 45 minutes in a Thursday night...they come around with a wonderful drink while you wait.  Worth it, very cool place with excellent food and service."
24/6/2022,5 star rating,"Definitely don't miss coming here when you come to London. There's a reason Dishoom's are remarkably well known and famous. The entire experience was incredible. It can take a bad day you've had and make into a spectacular day; even when if you have to wait up to an hour in the queue (which moves quick, the restaurant has multiple floors!). There's so much to explore on the menu, that my memory won't do it justice giving you the rundown on items ordered. Trust your wait staff, your senses and instincts when you come here. Don't be in a hurry and enjoy tasting so many dishes. The portion sizes were perfect! Spectacular experience."
10/7/2022,5 star rating,this place changed my life. definitely go if ur in london! make sure to get: -chicken ruby -chaat -okra fries - mango lassi - chai (!!!!) one note is that if you have allergies they will provide a comprehensive breakdown of each dish. however they will not allow certain modifications (e.g. exclusion of nuts)
5/10/2022,5 star rating,The best Indian food of my life! And great atmosphere and service and location. We arrived after attending the theatre and there was no line.
15/6/2022,5 star rating,"LOVE this spot! I tried going to the Kings Cross location twice after work and both times, there was a line so I didn't wait. I went to this location once too and there was also a line so I didn't wait. I then finally went online to make a reservation, and the only available reservations were around 4:30PM/5PM, which is usually too early for me except for the day I went! I made a reservation for 5:15PM and I think I got there a bit early, probably around 5PM. I was seated immediately and there was no line yet, but while I was there, the line outside grew and grew. So happy I made a reservation! Anyway, the food. I was given a quick rundown of the menu and recommendations without asking for them, and I ended up getting: - mango & fennel lassi: I've had mango lassis before but never with fennel seeds (although to be honest, I don't think the fennel seeds added anything). - pau bhaji which is mashed vegetables with bread: A bit light on the flavor for the vegetables but the bread was perfectly toasted, soft inside and crunchy outside. - tila foi which is fish wrapped in a banana leaf: The fish was a tad spicy but super flavorful, and I enjoyed the pink yogurt that came on the side with it. - garlic naan: The naan was a bit flat for my taste, not chewy, and very oily - that was probably my least favorite item from everything I ordered. - basmati kheer: This almost looked like a creme brulee with a caramelized, burnt top, and underneath it was rice pudding. Not too sweet which I appreciated, and the blueberry compote on top was delicious, wish there was more of it. Everything was super flavorful and unique! I really enjoyed the food here. Service was quite good too although I had to ask for utensils; my server looked confused that I didn't have any. Food was pretty pricey although I did order a lot, came out to be around 45 GBP. Would highly recommend, but definitely make a reservation! There's also pretty good wifi here."
24/10/2022,5 star rating,So so good! Great service by the staff. Love that they give included refills on the house chai. Dishes were spicy!
6/11/2022,1 star rating,"The most basic of basic Indian food for your crowd that don't know any better. Lamb chops were OK, but most of the curries had a very herby flavour. Presentation is nice, but not worth it when it's awkward to move the plates around and make room. Tiny portions and most of the menu's light lunches are, again, very basic. Go to Eailing road and take your pick of any Indian shop there to get the most genuine stuff."
11/6/2022,5 star rating,"The first Indian food I ever had was in London. The place was called Top Curry Centre. Sadly the place was shuttered just this past year due to the pandemic. I asked the hotel concierge who recommended Dishoom and now I know why. It's good I came for lunch because the lines around the block for dinner were outrageous. For lunch I was seated promptly to the lower level near the open kitchen. The place was bustling with diners and understandably so. This place was fantastic! The food here had depths of flavor you won't get at any Devon avenue place in Chicago which makes me wonder what happened to the Indian food in America which just got so bland. Anyway I digress, check out the pics and they will speak for themselves. When in London, this is a must go!"
15/12/2021,4 star rating,"Waited in line for an hour to get seated - the staff were very helpful as we waited and gave us regular updates and hot cups of free chai. The food is very good but I wouldn't say it was the ""best Indian ever"" like some of the reviews here describe - for example the house Chaat came with soggy potatoes and the lamb chops could have used more seasoning. Overall, our favorite was the Ruby chicken - it was a delight to try parsi cuisine as it's not very common back home in the US. The free chai was also excellent btw and I'm gonna look up the recipe to see if I can replicate at home!"
27/7/2022,4 star rating,"Okay, i didn't have  a reservation.  Therefore, we  went early hoping to get a table. The hostess was very friendly and sat us very quickly. The menu is extensive and can be a bit overwhelming.  We decided to ask the food server for recommendations.   We ended up ordering 4 dishes with some garlic naan.   Here are our favorites in order Chicken Ruby-  let's just say, we wanted to lick the bowl it came in. House Black Daal- this dish complimented the chicken ruby. I think it would compliment any dish really well.   Okra fries- the  seasoning they put on these lovely treats is addicting Raita- glad we ordered this. It definitely helped cool down the spice level of the sheekh kabab. Sheekh kabab- we probably could have done without this dish. It was our least favorite.  I like spicy and this was too spicy.  We didn't finish this dish. Bastmati Rice- we initially forgot to order rice.  Luckily, we remembered before the food arrived.  We used the rice to soak up the ruby sauce and daal, so good. Garlic Naan- it was good The okra, chicken and daal was enough considering . we ordered rice and naan.    I would definitely go back for the above.  I would pass on the kabab and raita"
12/12/2021,4 star rating,"Very central location in Covent Garden, quick walk away from Leicester Square. Most reviews are from Americans visiting London and not from locals. Line out the door and informed of 60 min wait, nice touch to serve chai outside while waiting. It was a 30 min wait outside and another 15 min at the bar. I don't really like this trick of having the patrons seated at the bar while the table is being made ready for you. Seems like a strategy to put the guest on the spot to order a drink. The non-alcohol pineapple cream drink was very refreshing, frothy and icy, coconut flakes served on top. Seated downstairs, although would have preferred upstairs, but with these wait times what can you do, and it would be long waits at most good places in the area. Open style kitchen where you can see the chefs flaming things up on the grill and beating up the naan dough. Prices are cheap looking, but portion sizes slightly smaller. Not so many sauce dishes. I had the dry style chicken tikka. No yoghurt, instead marinated in vinegar. It was very good quality chicken. Chicken Berry biryani also good, cooked properly and not just mixed chicken and rice. No complaints about the naan. Very difficult to get a reservation unless far in advance."
8/6/2022,5 star rating,"We had to wait in line for about 40 mins but they brought us sherry to warm us and we loved the bustling two story dining rooms. The menu is large and everything was delicious. We started with vegetable samosas (good but small), Pau Bhaji (delicious and fun to assemble). Then we had the signature black daal (good but not earth shattering), the jackfruit biryani (get this!), the mattar paneer (also a winner), the raita (thick and a generous portion), and the kachumber (good for your vegetable fix). We washed it all down with mango and rose lassis--also recommended."
12/11/2022,5 star rating,Incredible food and ambiance. Just go at off times because the line to get in wraps around the block.
5/7/2022,5 star rating,"Not huge on Indian food but this was hands down the best I had. I won't bother trying to ""name that dish"" because quite frankly I'm unfamiliar with them and would butcher the spelling regardless. The portions are on the smaller side, much like tapas, so be sure to try many! The na'an is made fresh in the kitchen on the bottom floor so be sure to try it."
21/5/2022,5 star rating,"this place is crazy good. it had been recommended to me before, so i knew it must be at least alright if it was worthy of recommendation. but i was blown away by how literally every item i tasted on the menu was mouthwateringly delicious. the bhindi fries, the bhel, the samosas, the mattar paneer, the potatoes, and that daal! the drinks were incredible too- the bollybellini is a drink i was thinking about for so long after that i actually looked the recipe up on the internet and will now be making it at home. plus, our waitress was absolutely lovely - so warm, and so patient at explaining the menu to some of our friends who had allergies. dishoom is so popular that it doesn't need more recommendations - people are clearly already aware how good it is - but here's some tips: get the daal. dip the gunpowder potatoes in the chili tomato chutney. and get the bollybellini- you will not regret it!"
29/10/2022,5 star rating,"Great food!  Lovely people serving delicious curries.  That is all I had to say, really, but Yelp requires 85 characters."
12/11/2022,5 star rating,Great shop and coffee shop ..high prices though but won't stop me returning as a treat maybe a salad garnish with the sausage roll  would make it a more acceptable price was lovely any way just a bit lonely on the plate
9/6/2022,5 star rating,"Yum yum in my tum tum because the food here is fabulous. Only gripe is that the portions are a bit small so we ended up ordering more after we were done eating. Absolutely order the Chicken Ruby. It is knee slapping good. Pair it with some garlic naan and you won't have any curry left to lick out of the bowl. We also ordered the watermelon and passion fruit drinks, which were completely guilt free as they were only 67 calories and remarkably refreshing. Be sure to make reservations beforehand as they are extremely popular. I apologize for the low quality photos as they were screenshots from excitement-fueled videos"
14/11/2021,4 star rating,We went to the Covent gardens location. We could not get a reservation but they accepted walk ins. We arrived just as breakfast was ending and lunch was starting. They had amazing oat milk chai and my son had a vegan mango lassi. They had vegan and gf options and all the food was good. The puris that hubby got were a bit burned and the charged per extra puri requested. Service was good and the place was very busy. Definitely a family favourite!!
9/5/2022,5 star rating,"The best Indian restaurant I have ever visited. Love the modern take on traditional dishes. The chai tea was strong and perfectly sweetened. The ruby chicken is the star of the show and a must order. The chef's special fish was good but very spicy! The corn was pretty standard, as was the broccoli salad. The gulab jamun dessert is also a must order. Everything was fantastic. This location is the only one that allows reservations online in the daytime (not dinner). Lines get super long but absolutely worth the wait"
21/10/2022,5 star rating,"Amazing food and beverages. Kind and helpful staff. Felt welcome and prices were reasonable. Arrived before the long queue formed so try to arrive before ""normal"" dinner time and you'll probably not have much of a wait. Also ordered delivery once and was well packaged and hot/fresh. Try it, you shan't regret it."
19/9/2022,5 star rating,"Wonderful dining experience when in London.  We went to the Covent Garden location.  It was fabulous!  My husband likes Indian food but after Dishoom, he has changed his tune!  Our adult boys were with us, youngest was studying abroad in London & they love it too.  Our son wished he would have discovered it while he was there, rather than on the last day of our visit to pick him up & bring him home!  Great food, lots of variety for all tastes.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!"
19/9/2022,5 star rating,"If we could do a 6-star review for Dishoom, we would. This was our FAVORITE breakfast in a two week trip to Europe! We made sure to make a reservation, as we'd read how crowded it can get. There was a line from opening time and they were consistently seating tables. The ambiance and atmosphere is so beautiful and peaceful and a great complement to the food. We both had the house chai (which I would have taken a jug of with me, if I could). It is warm with a bit of spice and just makes you feel calm and happy. It's the perfect morning drink. It's also bottomless until 5 pm so they will continue to give you refills (and the price was only 3.50 GBP--a steal!). I had the double bacon naan roll and my husband had the Wrestler's naan roll and we also got the uttapam pancakes to share. This was a lot of food for us in the morning so we couldn't finish the pancakes but I still have dreams about how amazing the naan rolls were. The bacon is amazing and so flavorful, the naan is very fresh and then it's complemented with a balance of cilantro as a garnish, cream cheese spread on the naan, and a tomato-chili jam which is not too spicy and out of this world. It was so good we went to Dishoom Kings Cross two days later to get the same breakfast and buy their house chai to bring home!!! If I could have breakfast here every day, I would and probably wouldn't get tired of it. Run, don't walk to Dishoom!"
10/4/2022,4 star rating,"Vibrant and exciting restaurant located now in Covent Gardens! The wait to enter was worthwhile. All of our dishes were fabulous. Although the service was generally good, we had to ask for water refills several times."
7/7/2022,5 star rating,"I wanted to check out the hype so my friend and I got into the long queue outside the doors on a Thursday evening. The line moved quickly, but for my party of 5, we got sat in 10 minutes! Our waiter was very accommodating to us putting in our orders multiple times and keeping our menu with us. Specifically for the food, it was absolutely delicious, especially for the price. THE CHAI was bottomless and the best chai I've actually ever had. We had asked the server for advice on what to order and all of it was delicious. Things I ordered that I would definitely get again: Bhel, Chili Chicken, Chai, Lamb Seekh Kabab, Mattar Paneer, Kulfi Malai"
21/10/2022,5 star rating,"One of the best meals of my life. Had the Chicken Ruby and the chicken was so perfectly cooked, it's melts in your mouth. A MUST do in London!!"
3/9/2022,5 star rating,"Yes, there will be a line and wait when you arrive (without reservations), but it moves quickly and it's totally worth the wait. All the dishes were full of flavor and cooked to perfection, the chicken tikka is chef's kiss. One of my highlights while in London."
2/5/2022,5 star rating,"First breakfast in London when we arrived from the U.S.! The restaurant was walking distance from our hotel. Loved the interior decor, very Parisan with a modern twist. Was worried I should have made reservations beforehand, but the restaurant was pretty empty, got a spot by the windows. Ordered the Parsi omelette and sausage & egg naan roll. They are known for their naan rolls and it didn't disappoint! The sunny side-up egg paired so well with the sausage and tomato chili jam. Still thinking about this dish! The Parsi omelette was tasty, but not anything outstanding. The plate they served it on was beautiful though."
26/4/2022,5 star rating,"Some of the most mouth watering Indian food I've ever had! So much flavor so much taste. A must try for breakfast, lunch or dinner when you are in London. I will certainly be back here in my next trip."
22/7/2022,5 star rating,"I love Dishoom. Having moved from LA to London and finally getting good Indian food has been such a treat. Dishoom is authentic, delicious, busy (so definitely reserve) and with plenty of options! My kid is allergic to dairy, and their vegan naan was mind blowing- so light and airy and absolutely delicious. The service is wonderful too. Must get their chicken ruby. Never ever disappoints. Honestly, haven't had anything disappointing at any of the locations."
23/10/2022,5 star rating,"Great food, wonderful ambiance. Great place to take people first trying Indian as well."
22/10/2022,5 star rating,Everything about Dishoom is amazing! The food is outstanding and the staff is exceptional!
9/8/2022,5 star rating,They don't take reservation for 2 so we decided to walk in and see how long we could wait. It was actually not bad at all we waited about 20 mins and everything tasted DELICIOUS!!! Service was great too our waiter was super friendly and gave great recommendations! If you're in London I highly highly recommend trying this restaurant.
6/9/2021,5 star rating,"If you like Indian food but are wary of the consistently great reviews (and long lines at some of their locations) - come here! The food is worth it! Food/drinks: We were advised to get 6 plates to share for 2, and ended up with dahl, fried mutton,  veggie bowl, naan, roti, and - my personal favorite - fish cooked in banana leaves. It was slightly more food than we needed but with the explosive flavors and tender preparation, was worth every bite. Service: It was fine. We were seated quickly for lunch, our server explained the menu and gave good suggestions. They did get busy so we had to flag her down for the bill. Ambiance: Memorable. We sat inside on the main floor, but it's worth a peak at the lower level as well. There were so many thoughtful details pointing to an Indian-British nostalgic vibe, down to the toilets in the ladies bathroom. Also fun to see the open kitchen. Highly recommend. Some of the best Indian food I've had."
9/8/2022,4 star rating,"Nice Dishoom restaurant very similar to the others. I had the Tila-Foi's Malasa Fish, the Covent Garden special, which was really good as the spices complemented the fish instead of covering it, and it was also a pretty big portion."
20/7/2022,4 star rating,Excellent Indian food in a city that has many options!  My wife and I really enjoyed the mixed appetizer.  She had the prawns and I had lamb - both were very tasty!
15/10/2022,4 star rating,"Worth the wait in line, which moved surprisingly quickly. Our table sucked but after waiting wasn't going to complain. Service outstanding. Food delicious."
9/4/2022,5 star rating,"Went here for lunch while in London on a business trip. Although I didn't have a reservation, I was able to be seated within 15 minutes as it was just me. It was great to see such a busy restaurant. I ordered the Bhel and it was good. Adding some of the chutneys made it even better. The Vada Pau I ordered was hot and fresh. Using the dry chutney and adding the cilantro chutney made this perfect. As I wanted something lighter to balance out the Vada Pau, for my main, I ordered the Kala Channa salad and, with the chaat masala dressing, this item blew me away! What a surprising delight!!!"
15/8/2022,5 star rating,The BEST Indian of my life!! Go for it!! The chicken ruby is the best abs the garlic naan
28/7/2022,4 star rating,Got a reservation for 5:30 the last time slot before it becomes a wait in line. The lamb was amazing and the kulfi Ice cream too. Came out thoroughly stuffed
2/10/2022,4 star rating,"Better to get a reservation or wait while drinking a chai or cocktail and u will get seated. Nice atmosphere, I missed the live music, awesome waiter from Rumania who explained on his knees the menu...I had a solo lunch couldn't taste many dishes. Sauces are very tasty."
8/7/2022,5 star rating,Best Indian food we've had in ages! Get a reservation early! Highly recommend  spicy fish wrapped in banana leaf w sweet yogurt accompaniment! Excellent black dal and mutter paneer! I wish we could return but as we left the line was out the door and down the street to enter.
22/7/2021,5 star rating,"Amazing Bombay food with an Irani twist. All the food we had was spot on! Our fav was actually the Murgh Malai (although most people recommend the Ruby Chicken). The Murgh Malai is chicken thigh meat that is juicy, tender, and cooked to perfection (still slightly pink) and tops the ruby chicken imo. It's super flavorful and not your typical chicken thigh. Be sure to order 3-4 items per person, and don't forget the house chai!"
10/10/2022,5 star rating,Amazing dining experience from start to finish and dont even get me started on the food. 2 week vacation all over Europe and this was far and above the best meal we had and frankly the best I've had in a long time. Bravo to the managers and staff and owners for the vision. It's a well oiled machine and yet we felt so taken care of and never rushed. THANK YOU FOR THIS PLACE!
12/9/2022,5 star rating,"I went here its amazing. Food was delicious, whatever we ordered there just arrived on time and it was all pleasantly decorated. Ambience was perfect and the customer support staff were highly accommodating too."
22/9/2022,5 star rating,Great fresh food. Distinctive dishes. Great service. Every dish on the menu is worth trying. And the other reviews are correct - the Chai is wonderful!
19/6/2022,5 star rating,"Although I live in Los Angeles, I visit London twenty days ago. This restaurant was recommended by a cab driver, then Yelp confirmed it. My wife and I luckily arrived before a long line of diners formed in front. Our cordial waiter offered some suggestions and we ordered a bit too much food to consume at one sitting but easily warmed up for another meal later. We do have several good Indian eateries in Los Angeles and New York but we enjoyed our meal here very much and we are hoping to return in July to visit again."
31/10/2022,3 star rating,Such an overrated restaurant. This was highly recommended for our London trip but everything from service to good was just average. We have had better Indian food. Their famous House chat was average. The drink was watered down. The lamb chop was fine. The ruby chicken tasted so industrial . The naan was dry. This was a disappointment.
22/7/2022,5 star rating,Loved it so much we went twice during our last visit to London! Loved the warm up Chai while we were waiting in line! Lovely service both times!!  Great dining experience!! Looking forward to our next visit!!!
31/7/2022,5 star rating,"It's difficult to say if it was worth the 90 minutes wait time, but the fact that I am not complaining says enough. The black daal was divine."
10/10/2022,5 star rating,"Heard so much about Dishoom before our trip to London, I knew we had to go. We tried twice, first time was 1.5 hours and we couldn't wait. We came back a second time and it was 50 minutes at 10:30 pm. We decided to wait. It was well worth it. The food lives up to the hype and the service was excellent! The garlic naan and cheese naan were amazing. The ruby chicken was perfect. Everything we got was great and we would go back if we are ever in London again. We highly recommend. They take reservations before 6:00 so try to do that if you can!"
4/6/2022,5 star rating,"Fantastic chicken, beef, and mango lasses. Colaba Colada is also delicious, and good atmosphere."
2/10/2022,5 star rating,Wow. I haven't had very much Indian in London but this place was out of this world. A super attentive staff and hearty portions. Come hungry.
2/1/2022,5 star rating,"Almost not worth writing a review about this place since everyone seems to agree that it is absolutely fantastic! I wish they opened a branch near where we live! When we got there we waited in line outside and I was thinking the food can't b that good... well it is. We order 6 plates for 2 people and we ate almost all of it. We ordered the tiki chicken, the dahl, the samosas, rice, naam, n a lamb entree. It's hard to say which one was best or my favorite everything was delicious!"
14/6/2022,5 star rating,"This place was highly recommended to us which is why we decided to create a reservation. We went at 3pm on a weekday so there was no wait. The servers were extremely friendly and helpful, and the food was absolutely delicious."
24/1/2022,3 star rating,"I came here on recommendation from locals and travel friends. I can't say this was a stand-out place, I've definitely had better, cheaper Indian cuisine in the US. The queue to be seated was very long. They have outdoor heaters to keep sections of the queue warm."

17/9/2022,5 star rating,Worth it. Go here. ignore the local haters that say this is for tourists. It's SO SO GOOD.
26/10/2022,5 star rating,Lived up to expectations. A friend who appreciates great food recommended this place and it did not disappoint. As soon as you walk in the smell of the food makes you hungry. Great server who took the time to explain the menu and made recommendations. Okra fries were amazing with a spice we could not identify but we didn't care as we finished it quickly. We also had chili chicken as an appetizer which has a delightful bit of heat. Then we ordered the chicken grill and garlic naan and cheese Non. Both were hot crispy and soft and needed to soak up the sauces. We also ordered the house black DA a L which was really interesting and we stopped up all of it with the naan. And even though we were full we had to order dessert chocolate pudding with chili ice cream and basmati Kheer. The chocolate pudding is the same as a gooey chocolate lava cake and the other desert tasted like a cross between rice pudding and crème brûlée. Both highly recommend we left full but happy. We also ordered the gin gimlet a special which was limey and delicious and we ordered a second round of the same. The only regret is we didn't have more people with us so we could try more dishes.
2/7/2022,5 star rating,"Probably the best Indian food I've ever had, changed my whole view on the cuisine! Waited about 20 minutes, totally worth it."
3/10/2022,5 star rating,"Many of my Indian friends recommended this place. I found one that was walking distance from our hotel as there are many locations. As soon as I saw a line, I immediately knew it was for Dishoom! We got in line and was added in the queue list. We were probably 30 ppl back. I felt the lines moved quickly. The staff team served either lemonade or so while folks were waiting to get in. Once in, our server Alex was very nice (I had to asked for our server name as here, wait staff doesn't seem to introduce themselves much). We ordered few grilled dishes and starters. Everything was amazing to me! It was slightly spicier than what I'm use to, but still very good. Highly recommend!"
5/1/2022,4 star rating,"Pricy but reasonable and dishes are worth it. Never had anything like these dishes before so I cannot say it is authentic but I know I can taste good food and this was it. Customer service: 4/5 because waitress was slow getting to me but kind when she got to me. Price: 4/5 Food: 5/5 Sincerely, Cherie"
18/5/2022,4 star rating,The server we had was super amazing!  The food did not impress me.  My son like some kind of wrap with everything inside.   We went to another chain Indian restaurant the day before and thought it was way better.   It wasn't memorable to me.  I can't recall what I ate there since I have been home.   We were there in March.   I guess it is worth the try if you don't have to wait in the ridiculous long line.  Definitely not worth the wait if you are from area with Indian towns.   Indian food in Los Angeles area is much better!
30/6/2022,5 star rating,"This restaurant was a great Indian place bustling with so many people. We had to wait in line for about 50 minutes but the line moved pretty quickly considering how long it was. The chicken ruby was delish and the garlic naan was so flavorful. The mashed spicy vegetables were great with a little spice. And it was definitely worth the wait since they handed out little chai teas. This place definitely wins for desserts, the kheer was great, the mango kulfi was so creamy and not too sweet and the cinnamon ice cream tasted like a snickerdoodle cookie!! This was a great place that is only found once in a blue moon. Thanks you dishoom!!"
16/7/2022,5 star rating,"Whenever I told friends I was going to London, they asked ""are you going to Dishoom?!"" So I was thrilled to finally be able to have dinner there! We secured 5:45p reservations (last reservation slot of the day), which allowed us to bypass the lengthy queue that had formed. We were thrilled to be seated by the window with a view of the entire restaurant. Our server was efficient and attentive, and quickly took our drink orders for a delicious Bollybellini and Colaba Colada (highly recommend both!). Food wise, we started with the vegetable samosas that I think were my favorite part of the whole meal!Then we shared garlic naan (they bring 3 dipping sauces), the Chicken Berry Britannia, Chicken Ruby and Kala Chana salad. Despite going with items that weren't marked as ""spicy,"" it's worth noting each item was fairly spicy (we have a low spice tolerance, though). The kala chana salad and naan were a nice reprieve from the heat of our chicken entrees."
4/5/2022,5 star rating,"Dishoom lives up to the hype. We got the lunch feast as a large group (9 people) and the service, though slow, was adequate. Mumbaikars in my party suggested that the Bombay local cuisine was well-represented! Also, one of our party left a jacket and the server chased us down outside to make sure they didn't forget it."
18/9/2022,5 star rating,"It was fantastic every plate we had was delicious! The Fried Okra (not pictured), Ginger Lemon Tea, Spicy Lamb Chops, Ruby Chicken."
15/6/2022,3 star rating,"Don't get me wrong, the place has good food compared to other Indian inspired restaurants, but the prices and spices were too heavy. 1. The chicken ruby curry had too much flavor, and the curry overpowered everything else, which made the dish a spicefiled mess. 2. The house special has much similar effects. The sauce was too overflowing with too many flavors, which causes the downfall of the dish. 3. The appetizers were actually really tasty. The lamb samosa and shrimp were both delicious, but they were heavily overpriced. On the other hand, okra fries were decent: worth trying, but not great. 4. Both the lassis (mango and rose) were too creamy, and not appetizing For about 100 pounds, this was not a good meal."
28/10/2022,5 star rating,Super ambience and tasty food. We were served chai while waiting as well! Definitely worth visiting
28/10/2022,1 star rating,Curry wasn't spicy enough and open time is waay too short
31/5/2022,5 star rating,An irani Indian restaurant- so everything is kinda a fusion and taste different from southern Indian or Punjabi restaurants- be prepared for long line wait but worth it - my favorite was Masala fish which is unique to this restaurant
6/9/2021,4 star rating,"I've wanted to try out Dishoom in Covent Garden for a long time now, as one of the most-reviewed businesses on Yelp in London, this is also the original Dishoom which opened back in 2010. It re-opened in 2021 after a refurbishment and the interior looks really good. The restaurant has a nice feel to it, it feels very open and welcoming and matches other Dishoom locations I've visited, I do prefer the interior of their Kings Cross location, however, but this one certainly isn't too bad either. I did find the chairs to be very uncomfortable, being placed on garden chairs - I don't know how they lasted the refurb. I didn't find service to be as good as other stores, no one checked up on me during my meal to ask if everything was okay, this was frustrating especially given the fact they weren't overly busy, and my table was right next to where a couple of staff members were standing - they still put a service charge onto the bill at the end too, adding insult to injury! The food, however, was excellent, I really enjoyed my Chicken Ruby, which has a generous portion of chicken, it was well-spiced and well seasoned, the basmati rice accompanied this really well, and so did the gunpowder potatoes, this delivered possibly the best food I've had during my most recent trip to London. The way the restaurant is designed, it's meant for sharing, this isn't a place you can come on your own for lunch, instead, come with a friend, or perhaps a more romantic setting, order multiple dishes and sides and share, the portion of rice and potatoes, for example, was huge and this would certainly be enough for 2-3 people to have a good portion and leave with a full stomach. PRO TIP: Make a reservation, you can make a reservation for most of the day other than ""evening meal times"", the queues outside can get really long (they have umbrellas waiting), so to avoid being disappointed, it is well worth booking in advance via their online website. 4* - Excellent food, a nice interior, but lacklustre service means I will probably be heading to the Kings Cross branch in future."
1/8/2022,5 star rating,"Wasn't much of an Indian food fan before this restaurant... but this experience changed my whole perception. When we walked up there was a long line but it moved very smoothly and quickly. The waiter was very friendly and extremely helpful in picking out food items and helped give the best experience possible. Would highly recommend the land samosas, keema pou and house fish special."
24/9/2022,5 star rating,"The food quality and service is excellent.  Taste wise, there is a fullness and complexity to the flavorings but nothing overwhelming IMO.  We all liked their curry chicken, bomb potatoes, and naan.  Their somosas were a bit too small.  If you can get in line for a table before 4:30, you should be seated within 15 minutes. This location is very popular and busy."
6/9/2022,5 star rating,"Loved it! It had a long line when we came but the staff was so sweet and offered everyone chai while we waited. The food and drinks were so so good, definitely recommend!"
14/4/2022,5 star rating,"Amazing food quality. Great atmosphere and great waiter. The chili chicken was amazing, the daal was also great, had the chefs special fish which was very flaky  and to compliment the dishes with garlic & butter naan."
29/5/2022,5 star rating,"Best Indian food I have had in my life. Words can describe how much I loved dishoom. If I can come back to London, it will be one of my first stops!"
22/8/2022,5 star rating,Loved this restaurant!  We were in town visiting relatives and somehow managed to get in without waiting 2 hours!  The lamb chops are fantastic!  A Must have!  Would never have thought to order lamp chops in an Indian Restaurant but so glad we did!  Loved them so much we ordered three more plates!  And the chili chicken...an Indian Chinese fusion dish....delicious!  And if you're in the mood for street food...order the chat!
3/5/2022,5 star rating,my second time at dishoom and it did not disappoint! here's what we ordered for 2 people (and were stuffed afterwards): lamb samosas: 5/5 - the spicy orange sauce is amazing chicken ruby: 4.5/5 - red tomato sauce based curry hit the spot covent garden special fish: 4/5 black daal: 5/5 - never knew lentils could be so yummy rice and garlic naan to note: -rice and naan are not included in mains -we waited 30 min and lined up at 6pm on a weekday; would recommend coming earlier esp on a weekend -they gave us chai to sip while in line; that was
10/10/2022,5 star rating,"I am obsessed with dishroom, every single thing we got was so delicious and I love the atmosphere. The chai, daal, and cinnamon ice cream were particular favorites. Waitstaff is so nice, they accommodate allergies well, and it's a nice big place so we never had to wait too long . A highlight of our trip"
30/5/2022,5 star rating,"Service was great and the overall atmosphere was great. We ordered the chicken ruby, tandoori roti, and the garlic naan. We enjoyed the food and the portions were great."
6/8/2022,4 star rating,Exceptional service and delicious food. There was a wait around the corner when we left at 5:30 PM. Definitely make reservations. My only wish is they would pair entrees with a side (or offer a recommendation of side).
5/8/2022,5 star rating,Honestly the best restaurant I've ever had in my life. Expensive but worth every penny. Staff is wonderful. BBQ is wonderful. Curry is wonderful. Well worth the long line and wait. Enjoy!
4/8/2022,5 star rating,"Best dinner we had in London. There was a short line to get in but it lives faster than expected. The food was excellent, my family and I all loved it."
19/6/2022,5 star rating,"Dishoom hardly needs another great review, but let me just say that while the food and atmosphere are outstanding, the thing I loved the most was the service. From the moment we stepped into line and we're offered warm chai or sherry, we were treated with such hospitality. Our waitperson Arlind could not have been more gracious or helpful. He gave us excellent advice on which nan or roti would go well with our order and checked on us often throughout our meal. We felt like old friends by the time we left. Dining at Dishoom was an incredible experience. Can't wait to come again!"
20/8/2022,5 star rating,"Dishoom was AMAZING. Totally lived up to the hype. Food was phenomenal and so reasonably priced, and the service was amazing. Everyone was so kind and really just made it a great experience. Could not recommend more!"
18/8/2022,5 star rating,"Perfect lunch in London! I was searching for the restaurant near the Covent Garden and It was successful. Two dishes are a little heavy for me though, each of the dishes which I got recommended was fantastic! I will be back :)"
9/4/2022,4 star rating,"We had to wait for 30 minutes to get into Dishoom, but it was worth it. The restaurant passed out cups of chai and green tea for the people waiting in line. The environment was lively, the employees were friendly, and the food was good. The foods labeled ""spicy"" were definitely spicy! If you don't want a lot of spice, I'd recommend getting something that isn't spicy because they give out sauces that you can add to get your desired spice level. We were given cups of chai on the house at the end too. I will be going back!"
8/10/2022,5 star rating,Some of the best Indian food I've had around let alone vegetarian's food I only wish they had it where I live!
16/8/2022,5 star rating,One of the best meals I had while I was on vacation. The food was amazing! I only wish they had restaurants in Los Angeles.
1/3/2022,5 star rating,"I was looking for a good place to dine alone before a play and this was perfect. The curry and garlic naan were perfection, the service was fantastic, and the atmosphere is warm and charming."
23/9/2022,4 star rating,"Good food (but be prepared for spiciness!!!) but ridiculous long lines, and the restaurant couldn't really keep up with cleanliness due to the volume of customers. Loud with lots of big tables for groups, but not ideal for couples."
18/9/2022,5 star rating,Great place for Indian food. Fantastic value and lots of choices - always visit here when in london
22/7/2022,4 star rating,"Ok, I know everyone is basically obsessed with this place, I mean the line starts at around 5 or 6 and goes back for a block... although they do come out and give sips of something. We came early and got seated pretty quickly and although the food was great for those in our family that love hot/spice, it was everything else that just made this feel so over rated for me. The air conditioning was broken (literally during a heat wave in London with the highest temperatures EVER) and then their oven was broken so they would come very 15 minutes or so and tell us they were on again and then off again. We all got food at different times and that was pretty lame, and it was just overall pretty uncomfortable. I definitely was not a fan but my husband and kids have already been back twice."
11/8/2022,5 star rating,Really impressed. The food is exceptional and the service is also extremely good. Huge fan of the style of the restaurant and I have made sure to regularly visit the various locations.
30/7/2022,5 star rating,"Delicious!  Had the okra fries and samosas, chicken ruby and house black daal- yum!  Okra fries are a can't miss!"
9/10/2022,5 star rating,"It's the best food, period, I've ever had. I love Indian flavors, but this was above and beyond. The black daal, butter chicken, fried okra, lassi, the 0 proof drinks (teetotaler), everything! We stayed in London for 4 days and ate at Dishoom once every day (brunch, lunch and dinner)."
30/9/2022,5 star rating,Great food! The black dahl is our favourite.
30/5/2022,5 star rating,Very beautiful and big place. Loved the food. Service was great. It was a lineup make sure to book before you go.
8/7/2022,3 star rating,There was so much hype around this restaurant but fell short on most counts. The waiters/waitresses were actually very nice and seemed to have some knowledge about Indian food. The decor was nice but the food was a huge letdown. The chilli chicken was unnecessarily spicy. I love spice but this was just ridiculous. The chaat was nothing special (I've had way better) and the chickpea curry as well as the daal were mediocre. If you have had Indian food before I have no idea how people are writing that this food is good - absolutely not worth the price or the wait in line. Sorry.
20/7/2022,5 star rating,"The Boundary  Street has its own lovely character.  If the weather is nice, and even if it is not so nice, relaxing on the verandah sipping the house chai is a treat. The food is excellent and not to be missed-- not your usual Indian food. Don't miss the porridge or the breakfast naan dishes. The hostesses and wait staff go above and beyond, including helping us get an Uber in the middle of a massive heat wave. We will definitely be here again on our next trip to Londond"
15/7/2022,5 star rating,This restaurant was recommended by a friend and I had no idea what to expect. As soon as you walk in you're filled with an exciting vibe. We got drinks at the bar while waiting for our table and then ordered the best things. Ask your waiter for recommendations
2/5/2022,5 star rating,"Just wow. Can't go wrong here. I'm Indian I would know. Great chicken ruby, seekh kebab, vegetable samosa, chole puri, and everything is shareable. Lots to try here!"
11/2/2022,5 star rating,"Dishoom is my favorite restaurant and I love this location. I've eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. Most recently I visited for breakfast and got the egg roll naan and it was a great start to the day! I also really love their mattar paneer, jackfruit biryani, paneer tikka, and the house chaat. Love to get these dishes and all share at the table!"
20/6/2022,5 star rating,"Lisa, our server, guided us well on our food order. She was VERY pleasant and friendly--always has a smile for everyone. We're more than pleased with the food but more so with Lisa's service! If it's your first time at this place also, you could try our order: Masala Fish, Chicken Ruby, and Black Daal with roti and rice as accompaniment."
11/7/2022,5 star rating,This place was so worth the hour wait!!!!  The menu is perfect for trying new dishes and sharing with family.  The freshly baked naan bread is addictive.   Dishoom is a must try while in London.
29/6/2022,5 star rating,Would recommend to anyone visiting London! The food and service were both amazing. We asked the waiter what was good and he just about circled everything on the menu.
17/9/2022,5 star rating,"This place is amazing. So good we went twice on our trip around the UK. Tons of great options, loved the ruby chicken, black dala, and pineapple tiki. We had two vegetarians w us and they had great options for them."
29/5/2022,5 star rating,"One of the BEST Indian restaurants we've gone too. When visiting England, we make it a priority to eat there. Went to the one in Manchester this time, as well. Very cool building and vibe. The wait can be long, but worth it! Food comes out timely, servers are great and helpful."
5/6/2022,5 star rating,The best Indian ever. Get the black daal and don't forget the old fashioned. Delicious!
6/11/2021,4 star rating,"Good quality ingredients & very authentic flavors! Dishoom is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in London & I think about them often while I'm back in the states. While Carnaby can be a little overwhelming on certain days, you can always find a cozy (yet lively) escape in Dishoom's thoughtfully designed space. Great cocktails, good service & food that is always worth the wait!"
7/9/2022,5 star rating,"Was not disappointed, best Indian food we've had to date. Hoping they eventually open a spot back in LA!!"
9/6/2022,2 star rating,"Heard a lot about Dishoom but when came to this location, I was disappointed to see - 1- Very limited selection of vegetarian appetizers 2-  a single curry option for vegetarians 3- waitress forgot to tell us about the vegetarian dal option, which was not listed on menu but was available 4- Romali roti was burnt, hard and not Romali at all! We ordered House bhel- it was certainly innovative and tasted ok. Bhel- I was given the dry mix and the 3 separate sauces- garlic, tamarind and mint. I did not get the bhel experience: sauces tasted fine separately though Paneer tikka was at the most mediocre! Matar  paneer - As the only vegetarian curry option, I want this to be spectacular- this was anything but that! The spices left a bitter aftertaste!!! House black dal - there was less dal and a similar spice gravy like there is in matar paneer. It had extreme amount of butter- did not taste good or authentic! Jackfruit biryani- overcooked mushy rice which tasted sour and nothing like biryani! Pros- the only 2 reasons for 2 stars are: Nans were good Paneer was fresh I do hope that Dhishum does something to cater vegetarian population too. Unfortunately this didn't work for me or my family!!"
9/9/2022,3 star rating,"The place is well designed and the service is good. But the food is nothing special, for lbdon at least. A good place to go with colleagues or acquaintances for a light meal that will be inoffensive to all."
14/6/2022,4 star rating,"Food, drinks, & service were a 10/10. The best Indian food I've ever had! I especially loved the décor."
17/7/2022,5 star rating,"There is a reason this is one of the top rated restaurants in London. The food, service, and atmosphere were all amazing. Absolutely my top recommendation in London."
25/3/2020,5 star rating,"Kicking off our first international trip with the kids, we landed in London at some point in the afternoon, took the Underground to Covent Gardens, dropped off all our stuff at our apartment, and headed off to explore. The line for Dishoom caught our attention so I started waiting for a table, half dazed from the long flight but also trying to read our travel guidebook, while my wife and kids wandered off to look around. After about an hour we were seated and had one of our favorite meals of the trip. The kids still talk about the chicken ruby, which has set the standard for any sort of Indian chicken dish that they eat. The chicken is tender, and the flavorful sauce is a brilliant red color ( yelp.com/user_local_phot… ), which I might have missed if I hadn't obnoxiously used my camera flash to light it up (sorry everyone else who was sitting downstairs). We also got the chicken biryani and green vegetables, as well as some potatoes. Given that we were celebrating our first night in London, we let the kids order some fancy drinks. The restaurant has a very trendy and lively atmosphere. We sat downstairs where it was a little dark and packed with people. The wait staff were nice, even when asking me to please stop taking photos of my food with the flash. A very memorable meal for us and well worth the wait."
23/8/2021,5 star rating,"We are ended up here because we had flown in from San Francisco, it was getting late, there was a protest paralyzing parts of the area and we found this spot on Yelp. What an amazing turn of events. Other than the food taking a long time to come out, everything else about this spot was perfect. Spicy pork chops, chicken ruby, okra were all awesome dishes. What I just woke up still thinking about, however, was the Chefs Covent Garden Special. Sea Bream marinated in Marsala with other spices--it was simply one of the best things I've ever eaten--anywhere."
6/5/2022,5 star rating,Honestly we came here without a reservation. Waited in a huge line that I never thought would never end. But it was super quick and it was completely worth the wait. Definitely the best food I've had in London. We had a great time and really one of the best dining experiences I've had. Cheers!
22/2/2021,5 star rating,Some of the best Indian food I have ever had. Classic food yet unique at the same time. If you are in London this restaurant is a must!
6/5/2022,5 star rating,"Far and away the best Indian food I have ever had, and the best food I had while in London. Everything was incredible and I ate after I was full because I physically couldn't stop myself from doing so. The gunpowder potatoes, lamb samosas, chicken ruby, and chicken tikka were my favorites and if I'd ordered the whole menu they all would likely be my favorites. This was our first time here and when the waiter recommended so many dishes I was somewhat skeptical but I now wish I'd ordered twice as many because nothing was disappointing and I can only imagine the second half of the menu is as good as the half we ordered!"
16/8/2022,5 star rating,Great Indian food ! In the heart of London ! Service was exceptional too. Kebabs were my favorite
6/1/2020,5 star rating,"I was in London 3 nights and I came here twice. Then I bought the cookbook. So hopefully this should dispel any doubts as to whether Dishoom is worth the wait--because it absolutely is.  The food blew my mind and I easily had one of the greatest meals of my life.  If you are in London you seriously need to make a point of going to one of the Dishoom locations. (Note: This location is currently closed until summer 2020.) Things to get (in order of necessity): Chicken Ruby - maybe my favorite thing I've ever eaten. I ate every last drop of it with my garlic naan. Do not come here without ordering this. Pau Bhaji- I'm not exactly sure what is in this other than potatoes and perfect spices but it is wonderful. The warm buttery buns it comes with go perfectly with it. This is another must order. Chocolate pudding with spiced ice cream - You'll probably be so full by the time you hit dessert that you will want to pass on it. Don't do that. This is unreal. The chocolate is so rich and flavorful and it tastes absolutely perfect with the spiced ice cream. Black Daal - so full of flavors yet so buttery and rich. I could've just eaten this as a meal. I added enjoyed dipping the Okra fries in this. Garlic Naan - Great, but not particularly special. necessary to eat every last drop of Chicken Ruby and Pau Bhaji. Dishoom Slaw Super refreshing when eaten with all the other dishes! Okra Fries - seasoned perfectly and lightly fried. These were a great change of texture compared to everything I've mentioned above. Pass: Chicken biryani - kind of plain. perfectly fine, but unnecessary. Gunpowder potatoes - Good, but nothing special. Quick note about the wait. You can make reservations for breakfast and lunch. If you go for dinner you have to wait in line. The first time I went they told us the wait was 1.5 hours and it ended up being more like 1. The second time, they said 1 hour and it was about 30 mins. Seriously, don't let the line scare you!  They also pass out green tea, chai, and sherry while you wait."
23/7/2022,5 star rating,"The absolute best meal we had during our recent stay in London. The wait for a table was long, but made bearable by the samplings of chai and warmed sherry we were offered. Our party of five ordered at least a quarter of the menu to share and not a single item disappointed. The highlights we all agreed were the Pau Bhaji and Black Daal -absolutely delicious."
12/5/2022,5 star rating,Great food. I personally love Chilli chicken here but most of the menu is tasty. friendly people and excellent service
29/7/2021,2 star rating,Average food poorly presented Waste of time and money There seems to be no effort going into creating something really good
12/4/2022,4 star rating,Surprisingly tasty restaurant.  Very cool environment and lay out on the upstairs of the building.  The food is meant to be shared and is very well made.
30/12/2019,3 star rating,"I was beyond excited to try the infamous Dishoom, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype for me. My friend and I came here for breakfast. I ordered the Bombay Breakfast and a Bacon and Egg Naan Wrap. -Bombay Breakfast: nothing special, an Indian-inspired version of the English breakfast. Everything was good. -Bacon and Egg Naan: this was a big disappointment. Sounded delicious on the menu, but tasted overly sweet. Mine barely had any bacon, which would've cut the chutney inside. Maybe it's a better choice for dinner? I'll be back someday to give it another go."
18/3/2022,3 star rating,The wait is staggering and its not exactly traditional indian that you would expect. The bar was amazing and the drink were perfect so its a great social space. Good for a few rounds but its crowded with guests waiting for a seat.
25/7/2022,5 star rating,Dishoom is amazing. That is all. Love the Covent Garden reno!
26/4/2022,5 star rating,Great food! Loved the butter chicken and loved the daal! Highly recommend! I also really liked the service and the whole theme of the restaurant is so cool and creative
12/8/2022,5 star rating,"Amazing food & experience. A bit pricy, but fair for the experience you get.  Only downside is they don't take reservations, so you need to queue."
21/4/2022,5 star rating,! Is Dishoom Michelin star? This was my question while enjoying my tasty food there !
9/5/2022,5 star rating,One of my favorite restaurants.  Some of the best Indian food in a really cool space.  Waitstaff and hosts are friendly.
23/3/2022,5 star rating,One of the best Indian restaurants in london. The black dal and butter chicken are amazing dishes as well as the fried okra. The staff were super nice too
28/1/2022,5 star rating,"From the moment we arrived I loved the place.  The building, the location, and the interior are all tastefully done, and the staff who greeted us at the door were great! The food was delicious, the chai was as well.  Having the water in tiffin cups is a nice touch! We will definitely return,and we will save room for dessert next time."
26/5/2022,5 star rating,"Found this place online, was in London for one day and after having a wonderful English breakfast I had to come for more. Returned the same evening for dinner without a reservation and was accommodated. Dinner was incredible and the service even better. Highly recommend!"
29/12/2019,4 star rating,"Waited 75-90 minutes and it was surprisingly worth it just for that Ruby Chicken. Service was good and they really helped make that wait a little more tolerable with the free chai and Sherry. Food: The main standout dish was the Ruby chicken, and everything else was good but not amazeballs. + Ruby chicken: Essentially the best butter chicken you'll ever have. Tomato based do slight sweet creamy tang. + Black Dahl: good and buttery. + Lamb biryani: Good but very spicy to me. Pretty normal. + Garlic naan: good but could have had more pieces + Mixed veggies: surprisingly good. It's snow peas, broccoli, and kale. + Mango lassi: good but could have had more as well Overall, for the price and wait I expected a little more, but it was a solid restaurant. Would I wait again? Probably not unless it was 30 minutes."

5/4/2022,5 star rating,Incredible service. Flavors are amazing. Best Indian food I have ever had. Good idea to get a reservation
2/4/2022,5 star rating,"Amazing food! Well worth the wait outside, during which time complimentary taster drinks are offered. Each dish is better than the last. We have been here during two separate visits to London and have not been disappointed."
28/11/2021,2 star rating,"Update- I phoned the restaurant yesterday and there customer service has improved but still have not gave me a refund, the food was overpriced and I will definitely not be going back after my experience."
3/11/2021,1 star rating,"wow, disgraceful. when I was eating my chicken curry I seen the most disgusting thing I've ever seen, a disease filled rat lying at the bottom of my food. I was half way done until I saw it. I am disgusted and the restaurant should be shut down IMMEDIATELY. I asked for a refund and I did not receive  the refund I was hoping for, obviously I had to retaliate after I see a dead rat in my food but they kick me out. this is criminal behaviour and I am NOT HAVING IT."
23/7/2022,5 star rating,"Found Dishoom during a trip to London and decided to chance with our 9 year old twins who are exploring Indian food. It was an amazing dinner! Awesome service, fantastic drinks and excellent food. Our kids enjoyed their meals and we learned some new dishes to try at home. A great way to end a London holiday and highly recommend."
21/9/2019,5 star rating,"My foodie son who travels to London monthly said Dishoom is by far his favorite restaurant. He texted me daily to ask if I had eaten there yet! We stopped by at different times and it was always a 1 hour wait to get in. We finally stood in line and waited. Yes, it was worth it! It was intimidating to look at the menu and only recognize the name of 1 or 2 items, but our waiter was extremely helpful in his recommendations and descriptions of his favorites. This is what our party of 4 ordered and shared: Pau Bhaji (it's similar to chili. Served with small rolls) Chilli Chicken - crispy  spicy garlicky pieces of chicken   Lamb Boti Kabob - seasoned & grilled lamb (excellent!) House Black Daal - mild, creamy lentils, it's like a stew Chicken Ruby - 2 pieces of chicken in red sauce Chicken Britannia Biryani Bowl (a favorite) Naan (2 orders) Basmati rice (2 orders) Everything was excellent. Service was outstanding!"
21/11/2019,5 star rating,"This may be the best Indian food I have ever had. We were quickly seated in a cozy table in the lower level, and the waiter was extremely helpful in explaining the spice levels of each dish, their signature picks, what he recommends to get with what, etc. Even though the menu is quite large, he helped us narrow down our picks. Murgh Malai: These chicken thighs were extremely tender and exploding with rich seasonings. A blackened crust on the outside forms a layer of purely blissful taste that gives way to the moist, soft thigh meat underneath. Fantastic dish! Chicken Ruby: We were told this is their most popular dish. It is very smooth and the tomato really stands out. Black Daal: Probably my favorite dish here (it's close between this and Murgh Malai). It's savory, buttery, rich, and intensely flavorful. I would be totally satisfied if I had this and some naan for my meal. Mutton Pepper Fry (Covent Garden special): Moderately spicy, and oh so good. The spices really bring everything else to life, and gives your meal the kick it needs. The mutton is very tender and the sauce really penetrates the meat. It comes with delicious parathi bread. Garlic Naan: Even the naan is amazing at Dishoom. Amazing garlic-y flavors- soft, fresh, and doughy. Mango Lassi: Best mango lassi I have ever had. It tasted extremely fresh, and the fennel seeds added more complexity to the taste. I downed this pretty quickly... One thing I love about this place is that the portion sizes are small. You can choose to go cheap and just get a daal and rice/naan, or you can splurge and try many things. Another thing I love is that every dish is outstanding. You really can't go wrong, and with a menu this big you can keep coming back and discovering new things. Also this place is VERY AFFORDABLE. A+ in every regard. Food: 10/10 Service: 10/10 Ambience: 10/10 Value: 10/10"
3/7/2021,5 star rating,Came for brunch and was very impressed with their covid precautions and service! Unlimited chai refills were amazing. I ordered the Akuri and house chai. Both were excellent! Very friendly staff and beautiful restaurant.
21/2/2022,3 star rating,Great food.  Small plates were delicious.  Friendly server.  Complimentary tea and dessert! We are coming back.
3/7/2022,5 star rating,We had tried to come here for dinner the night before and there was a line all the way down the street. We knew we had to try this place so we made a reservation for the next day during lunch. The inside is so cute and it's huge. We were not sure what to order and our waiter was very helpful and suggested a bunch of things and said sharing everything would be best. This was the best Indian food I have had and we ordered the perfect amount of food. The prices are great too. I definitely suggest this place to anyone!
11/3/2022,5 star rating,This is the best breakfast place in London. Get the naans you will not be disappointed
14/2/2022,5 star rating,"Always delicious and a great dining experience whether in the restaurants, delivery at home, or one of their make at home meal kits. Consistently great quality and service."
11/7/2022,5 star rating,"This is a well-run restaurant with great food. I had to wait 20 min for a table, but once I was seated, the service was superb.  My server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful to me as I navigated the menu.  I had the matter paneer, garlic nan, and a small broccoli salad; all were remarkable.  I couldn't find a single fault with Dishoom, and I doubt that you will either."
29/6/2022,5 star rating,"The line was long but SO worth it!  First experience with Indian cuisine and Richard, our server, was not only informative but gave us lovely recommendations that did not disappoint!!  Can't wait to come back to London to try again!!"
20/9/2022,5 star rating,absolutely amazing! the fish special at the covent garden location is so flavorful and authentic. love the unique atmosphere and interior decor. great job
8/12/2019,4 star rating,"Ok, I don't really fancy Indian food but my god Dishoom was good! Where else are people willing to wait 45 min in 35 degree weather just to get seated?! Dishoom came recommended by a few people who have been to London so I knew I had to check it out! TLDR: get the Naan, the chicken ruby (similar time butter chicken) and the black lentil daal. The chicken is super tender, the naan is perfectly crispy and flavored and the overall atmosphere is perfect for a small group of friends :)"
27/6/2022,5 star rating,"The first time we tried to get into Dishoom we found a line of people 30-40 deep and decided to go elsewhere. We decided for our second attempt to book reservations at a less busy lunch hour. This was totally worth the two attempts to get in. The good was excellent, the service was great, and the ambience was classy and relaxed. This is one of the best Indian meals I had outside of India. I highly recommend."
29/11/2019,4 star rating,"London is known for it's amazing Indian food and there are tons of Indian restaurants all over the city. This place was recommended by a few friends and the crazy Yelp reviews made me want to try this place during my trip to London. I made reservations prior to my trip for lunch on a Friday. We got here 15 minutes before noon (our reservation time) and were immediately seated. At that time the wait for others was around 30 minutes. When we left the place, there was already a line outside. The service was amazing and our waiter was very attentive and friendly. Here is what we ordered: - Bhel: delicious. Loved that it was not soaked in tamarind chutney. - Okra Fries: loved it!!! Wasn't sure what to expect but these were seasoned perfectly and we finished it off in no time. - Paav Bhaji: loved it!!!! The bhaji was so well cooked and the bread was fresh and toasted to perfection. - House Daal: soooo good!!! I was so full with the other food that I couldn't finish the daal. As I'm writing this review, I'm craving that daal. Yes it was yummy. - Roomali Roti: this was a bit dry. In India these are so soft that they melt on your mouth. This one turned dry as it got cold. - House Chai: perfect for a cold day. It was a bit sweet for my taste but so delicious. My hubby got Murg Malai and said it was as good as what you get in India. Overall I'm a huge fan of this place and would love to come back and try their other dishes. Would I wait an hour to eat here?? No - as there are tons of amazing Indian restaurants in London. Make a reservation and enjoy the food."
16/6/2022,5 star rating,Delicious Indian food. Authentic and tasty with a varied menu. No compromises on flavour and spices.
7/7/2022,5 star rating,Fantastic Indian food. Not your typical fare in the best possible way. Will be back again on this trip and all future trips.
11/1/2022,5 star rating,Delicious whether dine in or carry out. Great service as well; one of my favorite Indian restaurants in London.
3/7/2022,1 star rating,The food is alright.  Wait staff is so rude. There are better Indian restaurants out there.
20/7/2019,4 star rating,"After eating here I can understand why people stand in line at every location of this mini chain st all hours of the day and night. Really fab Indian food. The queue is no joke. They quoted 1.5 hours for two people on a Saturday night. It goes fast and you can enjoy a complimentary chai or sherry while you wait. It's a bit deceiving because getting to the front of the line gets you only as far as a seat at the bar where you get a pager and wait some more. Eventually you make it to the table. Servers are friendly and food comes out pretty quickly. We loved the black daal, garlic naan, chili broccoli salad (it has a kick!), and veg curry. I didn't love the pineapple that came with the grilled paneer  cheese- the flavor combo just didn't work for me. Roti bread- think fresh made tortilla- was ok, but not worth 3.20£ for a single piece and not as good as the garlic naan. Would recommend, but plan ahead for the wait time."
30/7/2019,3 star rating,"Our wait was about 90 mins, which included 3 different types of lines. I will say the restaurant does a fabulous job of helping with the long waits with bringing around chai and drinks. We chatted with others in line so it went by pretty quickly. It was also a Saturday evening in the middle of the summer so we expected long waits. After we were seated, we ordered chicken tikka, chicken tikka wrap, Dahl, Chile chicken, sauces with chips, naan and butter chicken. Overall hits and misses. While the food was delicious I expected a bit more because of the hype and the fact that it's Indian food in London. Chicken tikka: 3 stars. I expected the creamy gravy based dish I always order at Indian restaurants however that wasn't the case here. It's dry and too salty for me. Chicken tikka role: 3 stars. It's ehh. Best part is the bread which you can order on the side Dahl: 2 stars. I think this was the worst. Tasted burnt Chile chicken: 4.5 stars. Best dish of the night Butter chicken: 4 stars. Standard but delicious Naan: 2.5 stars. Burnt and hard. Red flag. Not worth the hype in my opinion but maybe I just have different tastes."
19/6/2022,5 star rating,"Best restaurant visited during our time in London.  Don't be discouraged by the line, it moves quick and is worth the wait.  Friendly staff and very enjoyable family style meal. To quote our server.. you will leave full and happy.  Indian food that you will be familiar with in addition to selections that were new to us."
29/6/2022,5 star rating,Delicious food and you get a lot. I went here for breakfast and the service was great
20/6/2019,4 star rating,"I wanted to LOVE this place after waiting on line for an hour to get in. First time I've ever done that, and likely the last! But alas, the food was just okay. -5 stars for service. they served hot masala chai to all who were lined up on the sidewalk. Even seconds if you wanted it. And waitstaff was courteous and attentive. I did hear my server making the SAME recommendation over and over for the house special (and he told me I shouldn't get lamb), but sometimes they push what they want to sell. -4 stars for decor and ambience. Upstairs is brighter, louder and more expansive, while downstairs is dark and cozy. Almost too dark - me and others had to use flashlights on our phones to see the menu. However  it is a bit romantic down there. bathrooms are nice too. -3.5 for food. I ordered fried okra for an appetizer and some kind of chicken for a main. Both were salty and neither were particularly pleasing to my palate. I was warned the chicken came with no sauce but still expected them to be juicy since they were chicken thighs. wrong! I may have enjoyed the experience more had I chosen different things to eat, but that's my struggle with extensive Indian menus (trying to pick something) so  I play it safe. Rating would be a 3.5 if not for great service."
2/7/2019,5 star rating,"Awesome food! I made a reservation at 5.30 PM. But if you come for lunch, there was no wait. I walked by around 8-9ish PM, they had long line, it started around 5.30 PM. So reservation at 5.30 PM recommended. We ordered the black daal, cheese naan, rice, chicken tikka, and chicken ruby. All are amazing! Taste is on point and we left happy."
18/8/2019,5 star rating,"Dishoom is a must visit when in London. I've visited two different locations on recent trips & the meal has been a highlight of my vacation both times. Dishoom is just an experience. The space is beautifully designed and decorated in a way where every element is interesting. The lighting, the colors, the textures create an old Hollywood ambiance with a touch of vintage glam. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating, they want you to be there and have an amazing meal. They will walk you through the menu and help your meal cater to your liking. The food is absolutely amazing. Out of this world. Authentic flavors. Crave-able, legendary dishes. I can't recommended this restaurant more. Tip: request a table by the kitchen and titular be captivated by the chefs working their magic."
26/6/2022,5 star rating,"Black dal, Ruby chicken and chilli chicken are uncomparable.  Every cocktail we tried was fantastic as well. Will keep coming back regularly!"
2/6/2019,5 star rating,"It's official: My favorite Indian restaurant I have ever tried! * * * EXPERIENCE * * * Made a reservation two months in advance for one person at 12:15pm. I highly recommend anyone wanting to try this place out making a reservation, by the time I arrived at around noon the line was very long, it's centrally located in a busy area which explains why. Inside the restaurant it's got a hip vibe, pretty lively and everyone was enjoying their time. There were so many choices on the menu I really wanted to try out everything, my server was super helpful to help me narrow down some choices. * * * FOOD * * * Chicken Ruby: A It's hard to describe this dish, I just knew it's extremely tasty! It's slightly sweet, a bit spicy but was edible for me, and the rest there was just lots of unknown spices in it, with some basil and tomato notes. The chicken was very tender. House Black Daal: A It's less spicy than chicken ruby, there were beans in it, and that's all I know how to describe it, I guess I don't have enough vocabulary to describe Indian dishes, all I knew was it's super yummy. Roti: A Don't forget this most important dish in order to dip into the two sauces above. The texture was very soft, there's some grilled taste to it and there's not really any other flavor to it, which was on point because I could truly enjoy the sauces flavor without distraction. Dishoom is a restaurant I must go back whenever I have a chance to visit London again!"
24/9/2019,4 star rating,"1750 Yelp reviews. All good so we had to eat here when we were in London. Wouldn't wait an hour on line anywhere to eat so we ate here for lunch. You check in upstairs. Apparantly you can make reservations here for lunch. We were sent downstairs to wait by the bar. The entire downstairs was packed. 15 minutes passed and our beeper went off. No seats available upstairs so we ate downstairs. Tables are very close to each other. Our waiter was very friendly and helped us order. We had vegetable samosa, side of vegetables (broccoli, kale and green beans), raita, rice, nan and chicken.   All the food here is very good.  Would return (for lunch hahaha)"
23/5/2022,5 star rating,"Everything was amazing but if you don't try the chicken ruby, you're not living your best life. This place is well worth the money. I'd eat here very often if I lived nearby."
10/9/2019,5 star rating,Expect a wait. But worth every minute A line forms every day so expect a 40min to hour wait (can make a reservation if Party is 6 or more). Environment is happening and there is wonderful aromas everywhere. We had the mutton pepper fry which was tender with amazing complex flavors. We didn't want this dish to end. We also had the lamb both kabob (not on a skewer which surprised) and the chicken ruby. It was all amazing. This is a top 5 restaurant experience and a must if in London.
5/12/2021,4 star rating,"It looked more like a store than a restaurant from outside and it definitely was a rather noisy atmosphere inside. The menu was however big and we ordered a lot of different dishes to share at the table. Everything was delicious, except for the ""shaved ice"" which the waiter did warn us was a thing that not all would like. We thought we wanted the adventure and tried it anyway. :) The drinks were also amazing with many alcohol free options. I will absolutely come back again!"
8/9/2019,4 star rating,"Came here because I love Indian food and was not disappointed, but would not rate it as highly if I had to wait more than 45 minutes. I was surprised that at 2pm on a Monday there was already a line. Luckily they served the folks waiting in line lemonade for the first waiting area on the street.  Once we were moved into the final waiting area downstairs in front of the bar, we were a little disappointed that we couldn't order a drink.  We literally just sat there until we were called. Once that wait was over, we were seated in the top floor and were met by our server quickly.  We ordered the Rose and Cardamom Lassi, Aflatoon's colada, and the Fresh Nimbu Soda, which were unique and delicious.  For food, the Black Daal, Spicy Lambchops, Samosas, Chicken Ruby and Garlic Naan were our go to selections.   Everything was incredible except for the Black Daal, it was surprisingly bland.  All in all, great service, great food, but would definitely make a reservation instead of waiting next time."
24/4/2019,5 star rating,"Dishoom was bookmarked on my collection for quite sometime now. I was finally able to try this place during my last visit to London. It was simply one of the best meals we've had during our time in London. We liked it so much that we we went back there twice to try their breakfast and lunch menu as well. The food is genuinely authentic and to a wonderful quality. Everything is well made and you should work your way through the menu. The Okra fries, Chili cheese toast are definitely worth trying. Their mutter paneer, ruby curry accompanied with garlic naan/roti was a good mix, great for vegetarians as well. Fantastic food, make sure you make a reservation because there's always a line. But it looked like they had chai for those waiting when it was cold. They take no customer for granted and want to make you feel at home. We also got some chai on the house at the end, which really felt as a great way to finalize our already amazing dinner experience. Food, drinks and service were perfect! Goes without saying it's probably one of the best Indians in town. Covent Garden branch definitely better than others. Highly recommended! PS: They sell their own coins which is quite cute. It's blessed by queen's treasury. :)"
1/6/2021,5 star rating,This was #1 on my London Food Tour list and it didn't disappoint. When we walked up we noticed the long line *ahem* que but saw that it was going quickly. The hostess passed out warm chai which was the best I've ever tasted. We loved talking to the locals while we waited. Great experience and we hadn't even walked through the doors. This place has the best ambience. Plan your London tour around Dishoom!
15/5/2022,1 star rating,"I came with great anticipation with friends who always rave about this restaurant.  It did not deliver. The food was good, but I expected awesome.  The service was terrible.  Our drinks came well after our food arrived.  We ordered rice which came after the meal was almost completed.  Our second orders of food never came and our server disappeared for 30 minutes.  While I suspect staffing shortages were apart of the challenges, for the price and expectation, I would not recommend this restaurant."
5/6/2019,5 star rating,"I went here on the recommendation of a friend originally from India, so I had pretty high expectations. Dishoom lived up to them and more. The food was all incredibly flavorful and I am already planning to attempt a recreation of the black daal at home because it was that good. Prices are a bit high, but at the same time pretty reasonable for London. My husband and I shared the daal, chicken tikka, naan, rice and bowl of greens and it was a bit too much food for lunch (I should probably note we're both not huge eaters, so if you have a large appetite this would probably be more suitable) and therefore I'd recommend ordering one item with a side or two first and adding on as needed, at least if you're returning to a hotel with no refrigerator for leftovers as we were!"
17/6/2022,5 star rating,Was recommended Dishoom by a couple of friends and it definitely lived up to the hype! The chicken ruby was outstanding and the drinks were delicious. Try the old fashioned - you won't regret it. Will be recommending this spot to anyone who visits London!
14/7/2019,4 star rating,"We enjoyed Dishoom for dinner so much that we needed to get another taste before we left London. As our flight is in the afternoon, we opted for breakfast. This time we went to Dishoom at Covent Garden. The opened at 9 and we were the third table to sit. By 9:30, the room was pretty much filled. We ordered the big Bombay (which is essentially their version of the English breakfast), the keema per eedu, and the famous bacon naan roll. Oh and chai as well. The chai isn't as sweet as the typical ones we get which was great. It was quite delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed the big Bombay and keema as well. These are hearty breakfast choices of course but the better ones in my opinion. The bacon naan was good but not as amazing as I thought it would be. Overall the breakfast was a success and I'm in love with their spicy chutney. The dinner menu is better but I wasn't disappointed with breakfast either."
9/6/2019,5 star rating,"We came here on multiple recommendations of friends who live in London & others who have visited. They don't let you book a reservation for parties less than 6 for dinner so be prepared to wait a long time for dinner unless you come before their rush (I.e. before 6:30pm). We arrived around 7:30pm and told there was an hr and a half wait (it was accurate). They make the line enjoyable enough with offerings of delicious chai tea and mint tea while you wait. It is very rare that I would line up for an hr and a half for anything (unless I'm at Disneyland) but all the recommendations made me think this was food worth waiting for. It certainly was. We asked the waiter for his recommendations & explanations of the menu. He was very knowledgeable and helpful. We ordered the vegetable samosas to start. Thankfully after the long line we didn't have to wait long to actually receive our food. The samosas were remarkably complex in flavors and the accompanying sauces were a perfect compliment to them. We ordered the Chicken Ruby, Black Daal and Paneer Tikka with Roti. I honestly don't know how to describe them. I was so lost in the flavors and the experience, I'm left speechless. I have to note that often I've had paneer in a curry and I've found it akin to tofu, seeming to lack in flavor. Not so at Dishoom. The paneer is grilled and packed with flavor especially combined with the pineapple and a squeeze of lime. This is a meal that will threaten your good table manners and make you want to pick up your plate and lick it clean. We couldn't leave without dessert so we finished the meal off with the Gulab Jamun (a dumpling with citrus ice cream) and the Malai Kulfi (like an ice cream stick with a light caramel flavor). I ordered the Gulab Jamun and was amazed at the flavor combo. I wasn't sure about having a dumpling with citrus ice cream but the flavors married perfectly. I tried to come up with things to compare the dumpling to give you an image but nothing suffices. Just order it and thank me later. The ambience was lovely. The interior is beautiful and well designed. Bonus: if you get to sit near the kitchen, it is entertaining to watch the chefs make the naan. They make it look so easy! I would come back here and wait in that line again any day."
20/4/2019,5 star rating,"Love this place! Came here with another two friends. We got in line at 6pm and got in at about 715pm on a Saturday evening. This is indeed a popular restaurant! All three sauces they have were good! They suited different dishes though. Got lamb samosa which was great, and the spicy sauce nailed it. The chicken curry was great, so as the grilled shrimp. Those were a little on the spicy side but soooooo yummy! The garlic naan and the grilled chicken were decent, but I was not a fan of the other vegetable curry. Overall I love the dishes here! Good service and environment too!"
10/3/2019,4 star rating,"We've heard that everyone loves Dishoom and queues up for it. It was very good, luckily we made a reservation so we didnt have to wait in the rain. Its crowded and loud but the service was excellent and the food was delicious, well presented and good value. We went with the prawns in coconut milk, lamb kebabs and chili chicken.   Chili chicken was a big like gen tsos with curry very tasty but spicy. The lamb kebabs were good but i would skip them next time.  The prawns were in fabulous sauce & I highly recommend! We had the mango kulfi for dessert Yum! All in all not a place to linger as they set the time at your table but very good food."

3/4/2019,5 star rating,"Dishoom is absolutely worth every bit of the hype and then some!  Dishoom does not take reservations for small groups, and there is upwards of almost a two hour wait during busy times.  Hubby and I were able to be seated with only a 30 minute wait at 2:30p for a late lunch. The food is incredible.  Served as small plates family style, Hubby and I ordered: - Okra Fries - crunchy sticks of fried okra in a light batter - Chicken Tikka - Grilled and wonderful when paired with a curry - Black Daal - Black lentil puree to be used as a sauce and a dishoom speciality - Chicken Ruby - The B.E.S.T. curry ever - Garlic Naan - Enough to sop up all of the curry - Chai tea - served warm in a bottomless cup until 5:00p with the perfect amount of spices - Old Fashion - with a kick of cayenne pepper - Pistachio Kulfi - Ice cream on a stick The service was warm and attentive, but not overbearing.  The prices were a little high, but well worth it.  It was our best meal in London."
21/11/2021,3 star rating,"This place is ok, not great. The food was unspectacular and a bit of a let down for such a hyped place. The interior is impressive though."
19/5/2019,5 star rating,"Outstanding Indian cuisine located in the heart of London, just north of Picadilly Circus. Came here on a Thursday afternoon for a late lunch - reservations are a must. RESTAURANT: Two floors with a bar downstairs for waiting and casual drinks. I preferred sitting on the mainfloor to get the natural lighting. Cozy and comfortable. FOOD: Ordered the lamb, samosa starters. Three curries with a mix of naan and rice -- this is a must. Highly recommend getting a variety of them to try. SERVICE: Fantastic and helpful service. Server was great and recommending dishes for us. VALUE/OVERALL: Great value and will definitely will visit again!"
10/1/2019,5 star rating,"My first AND last meal in London! The hype is real and this restaurant is a must if you're visiting London. There are numerous locations throughout London but this spot was the most convenient for us. The long queue outside might seem daunting but it moves pretty quickly and there are people offering you hot tea as you wait in the freezing cold. As you get closer, there are heat lamps that temporarily help. Once you're ushered into the restaurant, you think you're about to be seated but you're just transferred to the downstairs bar area while you wait for a table to open up. My favorite dish at Dishoom has to be the chicken ruby. It's AMAZING. The curry is phenomenal and we had to order more garlic naan to wipe the rest of the curry clean! I just can't stop thinking about that delicious curry! The chicken was terrific and was soft and tender. Another favorite of mine was the lamb biryani. The lamb was properly cooked (super tender) and the spices in the bowl were spot on. I could go on and on about how great Dishoom is but you might be reading for a while. Here's what you need to know...if you're in London, you have to eat Indian food and that means making a trip to Dishoom."
5/10/2021,5 star rating,"I absolutely love this restaurant, every time I make it to London and call on a whim the staff will do their best to accommodate my reservation. They are also wonderful in pointing out the best vegetarian options as well as cocktails I may enjoy ( their espresso martini with a spicy kick is TO DIE FOR) I genuinely can't wait to be back again next year."
18/1/2020,2 star rating,"Not even close to worth the wait. The portions are small and come out way too quickly so by the time you get around to the curry, it's cold. The naan portions are way too small for the price and the service is spotty because they don't feel like they need to try and uphold their reputation."
6/3/2021,5 star rating,The food at dishoom is just as worth it as everyone says. Truly a unique dining experience and wonderful ambience. Only issue was the wait.
26/7/2021,5 star rating,"Top 10 Indian Food outside of India itself. I've never been so stunned. Ordered a lot of stuff and left a happy man. The chicken tikka masala was lovely, the naan was lovely, the desserts were lovely, it was all a 10/10 experience."

I went there around 10:30 on a weekday so I was able to get in without a wait. I noticed that there was a long line around 11am so I recommend getting here early! The naan roll is definitely a must! It was a little hard to eat because everything started falling out of the naan but the taste was amazing. Im going to go back again for their dinner menu but I definitely recommend this spot for breakfast!"
4/1/2020,4 star rating,Warning !!! If you haven't got a reservation the line is massive and relentless but don't give up as it's worth it. If you are in the mood for a traditional curry you are in the wrong place.  Dishoom plays with flavors and makes an Indian meets tapas experience one to remember.
14/3/2019,5 star rating,"I got the chole puri which was absolutely amazing. The flavors were so strong. The puri wasn't what I originally expected, it was more of a thin soft bread. But it complimented the chickpea curry very well. I think there was some green chili in the curry, making it a little spicy. It was a big portion and perfect for lunch. I highly recommend the chole puri. My friends have been here quite a number of times and have loved everything they've had on their menu. It's a great place to share and their small plates are good!"
16/12/2018,5 star rating,"Dishoom is my all time favorite. The closest you can get to MUMBAI :D We went to Dishoom in December on a rainy day for a late lunch. There was still a queue of 50 mins. They were courteous & provided hot chai while we waited. We waited out for about 25 mins and at the bar for about 20. The food was no doubt the best. We ordered VADA PAV, pav bhaji, paneer roomali wrap, cheese chili toast, black daal & roomali roti. For drinks- kala Khata, chillitini and the colaba colata   Everything was excellent, the taste was delightful & service was splendid. Overall a wholesome experience!"
1/12/2019,5 star rating,"If Yelp let me give 6 stars, I would. Dishoom is absolutely incredible! Pro tip: get lunch here! We arrived at 11:30, without reservations for a party of 4 and 2 high chairs, and waited about 40 minutes for a table inside, which I thought was extremely reasonable (the line snaked around the building by the time we finished an hour and change later). The hostess and waiter were both extremely kind and accommodating for our 2 little ones, which was above and beyond. The atmosphere on the inside is trendy Bombay meets diner and was adorable. Downstairs was even cozier and more intimate. We started with the hot chai, which is the best I have ever had, (you could even get it spiked)! The waiter was excellent and walked us through the menu and gave glowing recommendations. He let us know that everyone orders about 2-3 items, which was a ton of food, even with big appetites. We settled on the chili chicken (absolutely banging), chicken tikka (INCREDIBLE), a lamb biryani and chicken briyani (both spicy yet delightful), chicken ruby  (basically a butter chicken with sauce so amazing I want to bathe in it), and the gunpowder potatoes. We added some raita, a yogurt sauce, to cool everything off. The seasoning on everything was impeccable, and while I loved it all, the chicken ruby and chicken tikka exceeded all expectations and were absolutely flawless. The price point was exceptional, considering everything is meant to be shared. The overall experience was everything I wanted and more! A must if traveling in London!"

6/12/2019,4 star rating,"Delicious take on Indian Food, that came highly recommended by a number of friends and online reviews. If you are going to be in London do yourself a favor and just make a reservation! You'll end up wanting to dine here and regret it because the wait anytime of day is LONG. I had both dinner here and breakfast here and overall really loved the food. However, during my breakfasts I had an extremely negative experience with the service that took away a star. I had dinner for 1, in between the Harry Potter shows. Even with a reservation I had to wait about 10 mins to be seated, they are just packed. It was really nice seeing them serve chai tea to those waiting, unfortunately I just missed it as I was about to be seated. I ordered some with my dinner and it was fabulously spiced, but not to sweet and comes with refills.  I'm lactose intolerant, but this was WORTH IT to break out a pill. Ordered the Ruby Chicken, Black Dal, Rice, and Veggies. Everything was delicious, but wish they had another veggie option. It was just roasted broccoli and snow peas bland and limp. They are known for the black dal and it was rich and flavorful. The Ruby Chicken was creamy and tomatoey! I found this to be way too much food for one but was glad to get the variety. Server was great, but super busy. I appreciated he got me in and out as quick as he could and knew that bc of my reservation notes of my time constraints between shows already. Breakfast was delicious, I had to come and try their bacon naan roll fusion take on a breakfast sandwich. It was such an incredible, come in and order it! I made a reservation for 8am with notes I needed to be out as soon as possible within 45mins to catch a flight. However, the service was surprisingly rude. I got there before they opened at 8am. There we 3 groups waiting, and the servers made a big deal about the two other groups not having reservations. However no one was there, and it remained pretty empty throughout breakfast (Monday morning). The group seated before me was also Asian and they just automatically grouped me in with them despite standing quite separately and having all my luggage with me as a lone traveler. She seemed quite flustered when I mentioned I wasn't with them, with a very sassy ""Oh, well do you have a reservation then?"" I was then seated right by the door, along the staffs' main throughway between kitchen counter bar to the rest of the restaurant. Because of all the luggage and completely empty restaurant I asked if I could be seated in a less busy location, so my luggage would be in the way. She dismissed this comment and said this was fine. It was too early for me to argue with this and thought she'd know best. However, I regret not insisting because the next 40 mins  that followed was almost every staff member hitting and stumbling past my luggage. Yet somehow I never saw my waitress to even be able to ask for a water refill or get the bill. Never asked if my food was OK, it was delivered by a kitchen staff member. I waited over 10 minutes, after finishing my meal and still no water before getting up to flag another server dow, which is just so awkward! In conclusion, loved the food, will be back. However, while breakfast was great, what a shocking miss in service at breakfast."
3/11/2019,5 star rating,"You know a place is good when you get multiple recommendations from various friends before a trip. Four different friends recommended Dishoom. I definitely wanted to eat Indian food while in London, so I was determined to try Dishoom. It took me three tries to eat there, but when I finally did have dinner there, I was not disappointed. I saw the line down the sidewalk one day and decided to come back the next day. I'm glad I got there somewhat early (4:30p) because I still had to wait 40 minutes. They offered some sort of milk drink in the line, but I didn't have any. I did have some water, when I was able to wait at the bar for my table. My server was so helpful and provided suggestions. I was starving, but didn't want to order too much food so he helped me pick out some dishes. I started with the okra fries. They were so damn good. I could have just eaten the okra and beensatisfied lol. I love okra so much. The seasoning and the crispiness of the breading was just different and delicious. I ordered the East India Gimlet and it was also very good. It wasn't terribly sweet which is what I prefer. For my main course I had the Murgh Malai (incredibly tender and delicious), Chicken Ruby (the sauce was soooo good), and garlic naan. When the food came out, I was still chowing down on the okra fries. My server came over and kindly told me to eat my main dish before it got cold LOL. I devoured everything. I really wish we had Dishoom in the States. I would be eating there on a weekly basis. Amazing food, great service! Definitely worth the wait! Dishoom will be a must the next time I visit London."
11/10/2018,4 star rating,"Dishoom is a beloved string of modern Indian restaurants in London. Though you'll find classic dishes like murgh malai and lamb samosas, Dishoom's rendition of Indian food is through the lens of Irani cafes in Bombay. The Covent Garden location is largely walk-in, and rain and shine you'll find shivering hordes waiting to get in and being treated to delicious cups of hot and milky chai. We timed it relatively well on a Sunday night and ended up waiting about 30 minutes to get in, and then another 15 at the bar. The cocktail list is long and to-theme, including a thoughtful list of mocktails. The majority are 8.50 pounds. Cyrus Irani, my choice, was a straightforward tequila sour; Debonair was a fine frozen drink. By far the best drink here is the Hoppy Paanch, an IPA, Johnny Walker, and butter syrup concoction that tastes far better than that description. I drank most of my boyfriend's (oops). Once seated in the cozy and buzzing downstairs, we ordered everything to share, with a little help from our waiter. Complimentary papadum with tri-colored dips was a satisfying, if standard, way to start off the meal; pau bhaji and okra fries (4.50 each) were both well-done and nice ways to continue our carb streak. Our larger plates were spiced and fragrant gunpowder potatoes (6.70); decent lamb chops (12.90) strewn with pomegranate seeds; a fine chicken ruby (10.50); and a delicious but small prawn dish (17.50). Although we were happily in a food orgy, mopping up sauces with naan, I couldn't help but wonder what I was missing.Everything was done well, but nothing was really above and beyond in the way that, say, Pondicheri in Houston is. Prices are elevated but not too bad; we had a bill around 75 pounds for our party of four (excluding drinks), and that was somewhat inflated by the prawns. Service is rushed but reasonable given the popularity. Bathrooms are very nice. Decor and atmosphere in general is great. I understand why Dishoom is a must-go in London, and it has plenty of convenient locations, but I was expecting something just a little extra."

7/9/2018,5 star rating,"It is well known that London has a sprawling Indian food scene that serves some of the best Indian cuisines outside of India. Dishoom, a small chain of seven ""Bombay Cafes"", is definitely on the top of the list for both locals and tourists alike. Online reservations can be made for breakfast and lunch only. They do not accept reservations for dinner and the only way to get in is the old traditional way - stand in line! There have been times when we walked past a Dishoom during dinner hours and saw lines wrapping around the block. The ""Bombay Café"" style features a casual but moderately upscale and comfortable environment with cool vibes. The atmosphere is friendly and vibrant, and is always a perfect place to chill, and to grab some yummy Indian food with a couple of bottles of Kingfisher. VEGETABLE SAMOSAS:  The skin was paper-thin and fried to a perfect crispiness that when I sank my teeth into it, the skin just crumbled and melted away while the filling made with veggies and mashed potatoes greeted my mouth with a warmly spicy yumminess. CHICKEN RUBY:  It looked like a variation of the famous tikka Marsala which was a tomato based curry with cubed chicken breast meat.  The ruby dish, however, came with makhani sauce which was silky and smooth. It really tasted like tikka Marsala but with a stronger flavor of ginger and garlic. It had a nice balance of sweetness versus spiciness and was delicious beyond words. GUNPOWDER POTATOES:  If you asked me to recommend a ""must-order"" item then this is it, not just because it was so amazingly good, but also because you can't find this anywhere else. Skin-on potatoes were fire grilled, cut into pieces, then sautéed with butter and an abundance of peppers and exotic spices. It was without a doubt one of the most memorable potato dishes that I've ever had. We also had a roti to mop up the sauce from the ruby chicken, some rice, and a bowl of vegetables. Everything was good beyond belief. 5 stars+"
16/9/2018,3 star rating,"I have to say this restaurant is overrated. Their food is good, but it's not that good. They do not take reservations. We waited for about 35 minutes or so outside and then 15 minutes or so at the bar downstairs. Once again, their food is good but I don't think it's worth waiting for close to an hour. We ordered the lamb chops (my favorite), murgh malai, and chicken ruby. I would give 4 stars for the food, but with the long wait, I cannot give more than 3 stars. Pro-Tip: Even if the queue looks relatively short outside, it's likely to be a long wait as there are people waiting for their tables at the bar downstairs. I would not return to Dishoom nor do I recommend this to anyone. There are many other good restaurants in London and there's also better way to spend time than waiting in line. ****************************** If you found something useful in my review, please hit ""useful"" so that I can improve my reviews.

Always long lines, but they serve you Chai Tea while you wait. Great service. Fun, upscale vibe. Cocktails, bar, and full drink menu. Mondo Brewing beer on tap. Tons of food options from finger plates to entrees. Reasonably priced and all delicious. Overall highly recommended if you are in London or Edinburgh!"

29/10/2019,4 star rating,"Very nice evening. I had to wait a bit (20"") to be seated but it was worth the wait. Was served some complimentary Hot Chai while I waited. Once seated the service was prompt and very courteous. The Kingfisher lager was, as expected, very tasty. Opted for a small plate (appetizer) of Kerman's Pau and an entre of a spicy lamb stew fry with a side of rice. These dishes also came t very quickly (surprising given the packed house of the evening)"
27/10/2020,5 star rating,"Long wait? Usually. Busy bar? Yup. Worth the hassle?  Absolutely! I've been coming here for years, and by far this is my favorite Indian restaurant in London. Both London locations are terrific with amazing dishes, always worth the wait. I'm looking forward to the next time."
22/8/2018,5 star rating,"About as good as it gets. Most recent visit, got the black daal and regular naan to start, followed by the chicken ruby with roomali roti. (It was a lot for a solo lunch...) The black daal is amazing, although there's so much else I want to try here it's hard to say whether I'd get it again next time. The chicken ruby, on the other hand, would be hard to ever skip -- I get that this is the most basic of Indian dishes, but it's so incredible, and the one here is probably my favorite. Of course, the naan (both the regular and, especially, the garlic) are amazing too. I really liked the roti as well, but it wasn't at the same level as the naan in my opinion, and actually made me appreciate how incredible the roti is at Roti King (where I went for the first time on this trip). Overall, really amazing food for surprisingly cheap prices, if you can get in..."

22/12/2018,5 star rating,"Enjoyed every single dish I've tried here on my second visit (needed to try more after being wow-ed on my first visit. The one hour wait was worth it. -Service: Attentive. -Food: House black daal was beyond amazing, and I'm not usually a huge fan of daal. I thought I'd try it since it was highly recommended as a popular dish. Chicken Ruby was nicely creamy and flavorful (Heads up, it's a small serving for a main dish). Okra fries were good with a light batter (loved mixing the spicy chutney with the sweet tamarind chutney for the okra dip). Paneer Tikka was mildly spicy and a solid choice. This came with some grilled bell peppers and onions. Jackfruit Biryani was done very well - the spice flavors paired well with the curry dishes. Raita cooled down the spiciness of the hot chutney. Two thumbs up. Passionfruit Sharbat is very simple, but it's very satisfying. It's basically just fresh passionfruit,   soda and mint. Atmosphere: Always packed with a long line. Loud inside, but still feels cozy with the dim lighting."
29/9/2019,4 star rating,"This place was good but certainly not the best Indian restaurant I have been to. We were served chai tea samples in a little cup while waiting in the 1-hour line. The sample was big enough to the point where I was able to gulp it down at least three times. :) The chai tea was slightly spicy, but it tasted good. The chicken ruby was a lot better than the mattar paneer and black daal. It had a creamy taste that was kind of sweet. The chicken was soft as well. The mattar paneer had blocky paneer pieces that were about 1.5 inches in length, width, and height. The black daal just had a bunch of beans in it. The cheese naan had jalapenos which wasn't what I expected. The jalapenos were not labeled as an ingredient on the menu and didn't seem too authentic. If I come back to London, I may check out this restaurant again."
15/10/2019,5 star rating,"I'm soooo happy we listened to the reviews and came here. I've always loved Indian food, but I wanted my family to love it as much as I do. So I told them why not while we are in London? The food was to die for! The staff were delightfully pleasant. They served hot tea (I believe it was mint and chai) while waiting. Which was wonderful. It was a bit chilly when we went for lunch. If we are ever back in London, I promise we will be back!"
19/9/2019,4 star rating,"This place is THE PLACE. I wanna start by saying that I am dying to hop back across the pond and get in for dinner solely based on how BOMB my brunch experience was here at Dishoom Covent Garden. I've heard non-stop chat about how great this place is, so I was very happy to get in and try it out myself. I'm just gonna go ahead and let y'all know what I had and why it was the best: If you like meat(and boy do I ever), then you HAFTA order the Wrestler's Naan Roll: smoked streaky bacon, peppery pork sausages, and runny-yolked egg... Perfectly cooked bacon and sausage, with a brilliantly cooked egg with JUST the right amount of runny-yolk! This was one of the best breakfasts I had while in London. ON TOP OF their tasty food (and incredibly reasonable prices), is the House Chai...which is bottomless! Get the Chai. It comes out PIPING hot, so be careful with that first sip, and has the most comforting and satisfying spice taste!"
25/3/2018,5 star rating,"This is hands down one of the best Indian meals I've ever had. I knew very little about this place other than that more than one person recommended it on Facebook. It was only later that I'd notice that Ruggy and other Yelp dignitaries had experienced the majesty of this modern Indian tapas hangout slinging traditional street flavors. Being jetlagged and coming here at 4:30 pm probably helped my cause of getting in without much fuss. The wait was about 5 minutes and only the arrival of my East India Gimlet and lamb samosas were able to drown out the guilt I felt over snagging a three-person table by myself. Before I was seated, I waited at the bar downstairs and had time to admire the cavernous layout and dimly lit rooms, surprisingly sexy and mysterious compared to the Indian restaurants I've experienced in New York. I ordered up the items I understood to be standouts here, and they didn't disappoint. In addition to the aforementioned lamb samosas, the house black daal and chicken ruby curry were both out-of-this-planet good. I mean, plate-licking good stuff. Make sure you don't miss either dish. Looking forward to a return visit on my next trip to London. Come at off-peak hours and order up a bunch of stuff. This is a place for sharing, yours truly notwithstanding."
20/3/2018,5 star rating,"I knew I wasn't going to come to London without dining at Dishoom, I foolishly tried walking over at around 630P to dine before a 730P production in the area. Laughable!!! My advice, DO NOT DO THAT! This place is crazy busy and the wait time was well over an hour on a Friday evening after 6P. I stood there for awhile contemplating weather or not I thought I'd make it in and have enough time to enjoy dinner before realizing it just was not going to happen. I asked the host what time they close and if they are this busy after theatre. He mentioned there would be a wait later in the evening before they close but it wouldn't be this long at all. I decided then I'd hop out of the line and go to theatre hungry. I came back at around 1015P and waited for around 20 minutes and enjoyed the best dinner. All of my usual, very basic (I know) menu items: somosas, Ruby Chicken, Rice, Cheese Naan, a beer and their delish warm chai tea they pass out to the folks waiting outside in the cold for a table. Service was friendly, food arrived quickly and I was in and out in less than an hour. I'd definitely recommend dining here but planning it out accordingly since no one really enjoys waiting long periods of time to eat."
8/9/2019,5 star rating,"Having Indian food in London is really a special experience.  No matter where you go you will experience flavors and styles that are very different from what you usually find in the states.  That being said, Dishoom was an exceptional experience from beginning to end.  It was an unusually windy and cold night when we went and there was a queue outside and a quoted 45 minute wait.  We dutifully got on line and were super impressed by how organized the door hosts were and how we were offered complementary hot drinks numerous times.   The inside of the restaurant is fantastic.  Love how it's decorated - feels very different and yet special compared to most Indian restaurants.  The menu can be a little overwhelming but we tried a bunch of items and loved everything.  The biryani was outstanding and all the sauces and sides were incredibly flavorful.   I would love to have something similar in the states, but I guess I will have to find another excuse to visit England and to go back!"
18/7/2018,5 star rating,"I must return. With all the hype, I was surprised even MORE people aren't talking about this place. I love Indian food to begin with, but this goes far past the food. The queue was obviously long. But worth the wait. Mostly for such hospitable waiters who came by with different drinks like warm chai tea or sherry wine or lemonade. All so delicious too. Then it started raining and they brought out large umbrellas! The staff, for working at such a popular, busy restaurant, were friendly, upbeat, and playful! I loved that they weren't grudgingly leading the next millionth customer to a table. Can we talk about the atmosphere? The hanging lights? The beautiful decor? I was head over heels for everything. Even the toilet! The lamb chops were definitely delicious. My friend ordered garlic naan to share, and I was surprised the garlic was actually so present in comparison to other sad naans I've had. Definitely wouldn't mind using up another London trip to eat here again. Beware of an hour wait though! It'll be worth it."
7/1/2020,5 star rating,Came around 130pm and there was still a line. We waited about an hour before we were seated. - chicken ruby - YES. THE BEST - black daal - good but the chicken ruby was so flavorful that this daal became unmemorable - okra fries - Bf loves but I think I'll stick to my potatoes - spicy lamb chops - good! I really liked the pomegranate seeds too Service was fast. Would definitely come back
9/7/2019,5 star rating,"It was Day 26 in the Land of the Colonizer-- as an American expat used to spice and (gasp!) salt, morale was low as I concluded my first month of study abroad at Oxford. My poor desperate tastebuds, longingly wishing for the flavor of.... flavor. A day trip to London was suggested, restaurants were hurriedly searched, and off to Dishoom we went! I have never been more emotional when confronted by food. The spicy lamb chops, perfectly charred, paired with a bright vinegary slaw; the transcendental chicken ruby, spicy and rich, creamy and slightly acidic; the chocolate chai intensifying in the richness as the glass diminishes. . . When my friends came to visit, we went twice in three days-- when my family came to visit, we went twice in three days. Please go. For me. For your tastebuds. For Flavor."
10/11/2019,5 star rating,"I have been traveling several weeks and wanted something different than the typical bacon and eggs variants. Dishonest proved to be a brilliant call. I had keema per eedu, which is best described as two fried eggs easy over a chicken chili like dish. It had a ton of flavors, a tiny bi of kick but I would not call it spicy. Many layers of flavor, a ton of meat, very filling and very unique. I also liked the chai there, a cross between plain tea and a latte, and surprisingly came with free refill. Looking forward to going again."
18/7/2018,4 star rating,"I visited Dishoom no fewer than three times within the course of my four-day stay in London. The first time, my dining partner and I ordered a variety of dishes and tried two different types of cocktails each. While I don't remember the cocktails anymore (I believe they were whiskey sours), I do remember that they were delicious - although not the most alcoholic. We shared the plain naan, chicken biryani , house black daal, and spicy lamb chops. I loved the spicy lamb chops and ate all of it since my partner was vegetarian :); the chicken biryani, although huge, was a bit too bland for my taste with dry chicken. The next time, another dining partner and I tried the jackfruit biryani, and cheese naan. GET THE CHEESE NAAN. It was the most delicious thing I've ever had. Also, I loved the different types of Kulfi on a stick - my dining partner from India said it should've been only a few cents on the streets of New Delhi, but I didn't mind spending a few bucks for the most delicious and creamy dessert of my life. Great service - make a reservation and you'll be all set!"
31/5/2018,5 star rating,"Came to this place with a couple friends for dinner. They had us sampling chai tea and lemonade while we were waiting in line. The line moved pretty quick and before we know it we were seated. We waited about 45mins which wasn't bad. We ordered 4 entrees for the 4 of us. We also ordered 2 sides which were bowl of greens and basmati rice. All dishes were amazing and it was an awesome experience. Most of their dishes are dry and not saucey like other Indian places I've been to in the past. We were all stuffed and super satisfied with the service and food. Definitely a great place for romantic dinners with the dark atmosphere inside. Even though we were full, we still wanted to order more. It was impossible to stop talking about it after we left the restaurant. Garlic Naan: Oh my god! The garlic naan was perfect with the chicken ruby we ordered. The naan itself was just as amazing. It had just enough garlic and butter on there to make it super flaky and good. Mahi Tikka: Hands down best dish of the night! There were 4 big pieces of fish which was perfect for each of us to try one. The fish was super fresh and amazingly good. It pretty much melted in my mouth after taking one bite of it. I've never seen fish at an Indian restaurant before, but man this was literally hands down best dish ever! I almost wanted to order another one. Chicken Ruby: This was really really good. It was the red tomato sauce with chicken in it. There were big chunks of chicken in there which were super tender. I ordered some rice and ate it with the sauce. The sauce wasn't super overpowering the chicken or over spiced at all. I'm super picky with my sauce, but this was really good to the point that I would be able to drink it just by itself. Dishoom Chicken Tikka: This was probably one of their signature dishes. The chicken thighs were super juicy and smooth. They definitely didn't over cook the chicken. I will definitely come back when I visit London again."
18/8/2019,5 star rating,"When in London, one must Dishoom! This restaurant really embodies the true British-Indian cuisine of London, showing how traditional flavors can be highlighted by subtle western undertones. If you are a vegetarian, then this restaurant is an excellent choice. If you are an omnivore, please given the vegetarian dishes here a chance because they are much tastier than the meat options. The house black dal is delicious. Yes who knew that dal, which is one of the average Patel's staples in Indian. could be such poetry to one's palate?! I am still dreaming of this dal for weeks after my trip. Dal is simply made of lentils, but the way it was slowly cooked in the cream highlights the richness of natural legume flavor. Dip it in roti, nan, eat it with a spoon - however you like and it can't be wrong! Again, the veggie dishes here are the stars! The pau bhaji, which is essentially mashed veggies served with butter buns is a wonderful fusion delight. The buttery buns are warm out of the over and go deliciously with this spicy veggie concoction. It tastes almost like samosa filling of potatoes, chickpeas, peas, and carrots? Not sure what exactly is in here but it is awesomeness. Next on the list is the chole puri, which is equally vegetarian and delicious. It comes with 2 puffed puri (a fried airy dough usually eaten by Indians during celebrations), with yummy side dips like chickpea curry and sweet hawla. I like how the 2 different sides complement each other with bites of sweet and savory. I love prawns and the masala prawns were no different. They were so juicy and tender, slathered in deep smoky spices of coriander and chilies. Soooo good, I had to eat the last one even though I was about to explode. The chicken ruby is Dishoom's take on chicken makhani and it held up the standard of a rich tomato-based curry. I love chicken makhani and it's rarely bad - as long as there is tender succulent chicken bathed in a creamy spicy curry, then I am happy. This made me happy. I hope Dishoom continues to grow and deliver its high quality London-style Indian food. Please consider expanding to NYC in the future!"
6/10/2019,5 star rating,"Stand in the line! It moves fast and it was worth every bite. I would literally fly to London just to eat here. What made it great was the staff, they provided my friend and I with hot chai while we wait and were super nice. Once inside they tried to help you choose your food choices to share with the table. We had the Ruby Chicken (must have), jackfruit biyani, lamb chops, garlic naan, corn, bowl of greens, and dessert. I ate so much and was happy to do it."
11/1/2018,3 star rating,"Pretty good food. Pretty bad service. While visiting London I wanted to come here because of the great reviews. Unfortunately we came later on in the evening and our waiter was apparently ready to go. He rushed us to order, didn't refill our beverages, and didn't even check on us until he brought the check. We had to tell one of the other waiters to find our waiter for us. Since we were rushed to order and didn't get to thoroughly look through the menu we just ordered a few different tapas. Then he kept telling us to order more because what we had wouldn't be enough...it was wayyyyyy too much food! Some good, some just ok. My favorite was the okra fries. I devoured them! The prawns were pretty good just very spicy. I also liked the chicken wrap, basmati rice, and chicken ruby. The samosas were just ok. I didn't care at all for the potatoes. And I don't even recall the bread. This was my first time trying Indian food and I liked the flavors for the most part."
27/11/2017,5 star rating,"This is probably one of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to in my life. I had to wait a bit for my table, so I went to the bar downstairs. The bartender was so patient when I was deciding on my drink. When I was seated and ready to order, my server talked me through my order. She knew what i wanted and figured I ordered wrong. She helped me and she was completely right. I devoured my meal in minutes because it was that good. I ordered naan, rice, and chicken. Next time I'm in London, I will definitely be coming back here"
3/7/2018,5 star rating,"My third time there but first brunch with them! I love this place atmosphere: it's classy but chilled, the staff is nice and quick to serve you and the food... I ordered the carrot, apple and ginger juice with the homemade chai (which is bottomless...) and the akuri plate ( made of spicy scramble eggs, homemade buns and a plum tomato) Eveyrthing was delicious and very tasty! I totally recommend this place to enjoy fusion indian food for an original and tasty brunch"
13/9/2016,5 star rating,"Now I can understand why this place is always full because the wait worth the food ! The restaurant atmosphere is really nice and not too loud. The staff was good and really careful about your needs. We ordered several appetizers : vegetarian samosas, bhel and the phau Badhji. Everything was delicious and perfect ! The Phau Badhji was super spicy it was great. Then we ordered the lamb bothi kabab and the awdhi lamb and garlic naan. It was really delicious ! The lamb was cooked perfectly and it was full of flavors ! It was delicious and really fulfill, we couldn't finish it ! It's a nice place to have good, affordable and great Indian food"
24/1/2022,5 star rating,Great authentic Indian food. Very popular but usually a lot of queuing and I don't think you can book.
5/12/2017,5 star rating,"Quick summary: Delicious Indian cuisine in a lively upscale location I made reservations to eat here long before I came to town because I was way too excited about trying the food that local and non-local Yelpers rave about. The ability to make reservations online way in advance is an automatic plus-one rating from me. First thing I noticed was that there was a huge line forming outside in the rain. Once I mentioned the reservation, we were led to our table on the ground floor immediately. The kitchen is on this level, so you can see the craziness from your seat. There is a downstairs portion of this restaurant, which I was grateful to not be seated in because there are no windows and I get claustrophobic. However, when I went down there to use the restroom I notice it was very interestingly decorated, with little alcoves for your party and different artwork. It probably is also less hectic and provides more intimate seating. Here are the dishes I tried with photos attached: Keema Pau- spiced lamb appetizer to get you going Masala Prawns- Large, grilled, and seasoned Roomali Roti- A paper thin bread Chicken Ruby- Luxurious chicken curry Garlic Naan- Personal favorite for any Indian meal The food here is well spiced, fresh, and cooked to perfection. It definitely lived up to the hype and has earned return visits and recommendations from me. The service was impeccable as well. This is a perfect restaurant for date night, special occasions, and to treat yourself. Their large drink menu also makes this an option for you to make a night of it with coworkers or friends."
20/1/2021,5 star rating,"Worth all the hype! Chicken Ruby, double order of naan, and a coule of their Viceroy cocktails -- That's a night right there!"
9/11/2017,5 star rating,"Indian food in London is a must and Dishoom did not disappoint. Started off with a Watermelon Sharbat followed by a Dishoom IPA while Boyfriend opted for the house chai with unlimited refills. All drinks were so good that I often found myself chugging them. For food we split the following and it was all delicious: Garlic Naan, Vegetable Samosas, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Mattar Paneer and a side of Basmati Rice. The vegetarian curry was my personal favorite. The reviews do not lie, Dishoom is where it is at. Tip: make reservations in advance or you will have to wait it out."
4/4/2018,5 star rating,"London is known for its Indian food, but it should be known for this place specifically! The long wait, around 40 mins, was well worth it. We ordered drinks to pass the time, which were delicious. My boyfriend ordered for us, as he grew up with this cuisine. The naan was perfect, the sauces perfectly spicy or sweet, the greens seasoning were delicious, and the lamb/chicken plates were perfect. We kept ordering more and it seemed like we couldn't go wrong! Spiked chai was a nice end to the meal, and the service was great."
24/7/2019,5 star rating,"On a recent trip to London, I decided I needed to have breakfast at Dishoom. I didn't make a reservation, so I showed up 15 minutes before the restaurant opened. I was seated promptly after they opened. There is a brunch deal but it is offered to two or more people, and I was a solo diner. I couldn't decide what to get, so I ordered two entrees: the Vegan Bombay (featuring eggless akari, masala beans, and an assortment of vegan ""meats"" such as sausage and blood pudding), and an egg naan roll. It was a lot of food, but I am a trooper and I plowed through it. It was all incredible. The naan roll changed my life. And the chai was deliciously spicy. I loved it all so much."
7/9/2019,5 star rating,Dishoom is always a must when I visit London. I highly recommend going at an odd hour or you'll be waiting awhile. Their menu is pretty huge so here is my must order MUST ORDER Chicken Ruby Garlic Naan Basmati Rice You need to combine and eat all those together! This is an orgasm in your mouth! Of course throw in some Samosas to get you started while you wait.
11/10/2019,5 star rating,"Loved every bite! We ordered grilled chicken, grilled shrimp, bread, bowl of green, fried okra and a couple other items, I don't remember how to spell the names but everything was very good. My favorite place in London so far (been here for 10 days). The staff is phenomenal, my kids have food allergies and they accommodated us very well. My celiac kids had plenty of gluten free options.  Some items were a little too spicy for my youngest but we added a bunch of yummy jasmine rice to her grilled chicken and she liked it. Again, the staff is so friendly and everyone is so accommodating we wanted to have lunch/dinner everyday here. For a family of 5 we spent about 80 pounds. The only sad thing is that they don't do take out after 5:00 pm, so we missed taking dinner home a few times."
4/10/2017,5 star rating,"Indian food isnt usually the 1st thing I search for when looking for a place to eat. However, stumbled upon this restaurant and noticed that they had over 1000 reviews and almost 5 stars. So, i figured i can not NOT try it, and i am SO glad that i did! Ws ordered a few things: cheesy toast (it was like eating a spicy indian cheesy bread - delish), butter bhutta (spicy corn with lime & salt - dont order this if you cant handle the tastes so good tho), chicken ruby (similar to butter chicken - yum), black daal (lentil), roti and rice. Everything we had were superb! If i lived in London, id visit this place frequently! Highly recommend!"
21/6/2019,5 star rating,"Food/Drink: we started off with the Okra fries which was basically vegetables but lightly fried with a thin crust. It came with three sauces (all of which are delicious and we later dipped our naan in). For entrees we ordered the chicken ruby which was divine!! Definitely worth the hype, it had a sweetish taste to it. We also got the house daal. I'm personally not a lentil person so this dish was mediocre for me but it can really fill you up. We got both the rotti and garlic naan with it. The rotti was quite thin and couldn't absorb all the curry so we had to get another order of garlic naan which was amazing, hot and fresh. Overall the food is delicious and worth the line! Price: while individual items are average priced, piling on altogether can add up to a large bill in the end. It is worth it if you enjoy Indian cuisine though. Atmosphere: the restaurant itself was decorated in a colonial style, the ambient was dark and intimate. Nonetheless the service was lovely a albeit a bit slow at prime dinner time (around 7 pm). Tips: Be aware of the lines! If you didn't make a reservation, the wait could be up to 2 hours! From our experience, the smaller the party the better for 2-seaters are easier to come by."
6/10/2017,5 star rating,"A unique Indian dining experience, far different from the more traditional restaurants I have experienced in the past. Dishoom creates a fresh, modern take on classic Bombay cuisine in a visually stunning ambiance. Gilded light fixtures, beautiful antique photos, dark wood details, and intricately tiled floors provide a glamorous fine dining vibe. The interior is enormous, with two floors of seating. This would be a good place to come with a large group. Service was elusive and difficult to summon, but the place is super hectic so we did not really mind. To drink I tried the Rose Lassi, which was delicious. Nice subtle floral flavors, and the perfect amount of sweetness. We shared the Gunpowder Potatoes and Bowl of Greens, both of which were simple, flavorful plant based sides that would compliment any entree. My main was the Jackfruit Biryani, which was excellent. The jackfruit was not shredded as I expected, but served as larger chunks in a bowl of rice. Richly spiced and deeply savory, the tender meat substitute provided a perfect contrast to the aromatic basmati rice. The trio of condiment sauces served on the side further enhanced the complex flavors-do not skip on adding these to your food. My boyfriend does not like Indian food (at all), and enjoyed his wrap. Lunch for two came to just around £45-a bargain considering the quality of ingredients and generous portions. I would not hesitate to recommend Dishoom."
21/4/2018,3 star rating,"3.5 Apparently a trip to London is not complete without visiting Dishoom - if you're in the area I'd definitely check it out (there's a few locations around London). Came on a weekday afternoon for lunch and was seated right away. The decor is rustic with a mix of contemporary - not like your typical North American designed Indian restaurants which was unique. I really liked the vibe here - not too loud with bustling kitchen sounds and aromatic Indian food being prepared. There's cut-outs of articles on the wall and marble tables...it's quite aesthetic I have to say. I wasn't too overly impressed with the service, in fact I would say that's what takes away part of the stars for my rating. The waiter was questioning whether I knew Indian food (I definitely do, ahem)...in any case the food arrived swiftly. I got the matar paneer which was a curry made with soft cheese (tofu like texture) and the naan t accompany it (costs extra) and my friend got the biryani. The paneer was delicious and definitely had authentic flavours (can confirm authenticity after having paneer in India a few months back). However, this place was quite pricey for lunch...I'd go back occasionally if it was in my route. For the price I'd expect much better service and a more unique menu instead of standard Indian fare. In all not a bad experience and if you're in the area (Trafalgar Square) definitely venture in!"
22/5/2019,5 star rating,"My favorite Indian restaurant in London and the location was great!! Made lunch reservations since dinner is on a first come first serve and lines can get extremely long. Be mindful people start lining up for dinner at 4:00. Atmosphere: Buzzing with people chatting, relaxed, fun vibe Interior: fun with lots of Bollywood Movie posters and pictures Food: Samosa: delicious, hot and packed with flavors Okra fries: crispy, salty but our hands kept reaching for more Garlic naan: mouth watering, buttery, garlic naan (order lots) Chicken ruby: chicken curry... was exceptional!!! Biryani: rice... which we poured into the chicken ruby because both dishes were that good! Overall, my friend and I really enjoyed lunch here. The food was delicious and the atmosphere makes it lively and fun. Our server was fun and passionate as well. Make sure to add Dishoom to your places to eat list for London because they will not disappoint!"
8/4/2021,5 star rating,Such a fun spot! The food was delicious. The cocktails also very tasty. We were treated like royalty as we waited for a table.
5/1/2020,3 star rating,This location is currently closed until summer 2020. I wish I knew in advance before making the trip out there.   I did not try the food.
19/5/2019,5 star rating,"Excellent Indian food found here. We started with a Rose lassi and Limbu sharbat (Indian lime juice). For starters, we ordered the vada pav and for mains we ordered the dishoom tikka masala and a paneer roll. For desert, we ordered the gulab jamun with fruit ice cream which was also very delicious. Everything was hot and fresh. Service was also 5*. Highly recommend this place and we will be going back!"
23/9/2017,5 star rating,"This restaurant was fantastic and everyone should find a way to eat here! If you are coming for lunch or dinner, my suggestion is to make a reservation. We came here for lunch on a Wednesday and arrived at 11:55 and just barely got a table for 2! The place was packed. We ordered: -Rose & Pistachio Lassi (must order) -Pav Bhaji (must order) -Lamb Biriyani (must order but try the chicken instead) -Ruby Chicken Curry -Palak Paneer -Naan The food was all 5 stars. I highly recommend ordering the biriyani. It tasted just like my mom's homemade biriyani which takes 2 days to make- with the exception of Dishoom's lamb being a little tough and the cashews not being roasted. When I took my first bite, I was sent back 15 years to my childhood. It was incredible. Next time I come here I want to order the chicken biriyani. Now that I am back in Boston, I am craving that rose and pistachio lassi. As soon as it was served to me, I slurped it down in under 1 minute. The rose wasn't over powering at all and the lassi was light but had amazing flavor. Next time we are in London, we will definitely be back here! What was really nice too was that the whole restaurant is decorated with family memorabilia-even the bathroom stalls!"
3/8/2019,5 star rating,"Worth the wait!!! Incredible experience and food. Worth every second of the que. From getting a little taste of chai tea while waiting, to getting to our table and immediately greeted and helped with the menu, we loved every second of our time at Dishoom! The waiters are very knowledgeable of pairings and best ways to order for your party size. Ordered a Bellini which was delicious, had the prawn and the bhel appetizer, and the chicken tikka, veggies, rice, and garlic naan. All incredible! Favorites were probably the prawns and bhel!!! Great together, and the prawns had just enough spice with a cool herby dipping sauce. Can't wait to return!"
29/8/2017,5 star rating,"Trust me when I say the 60 min+ wait is totally worth it! We wanted to enjoy our last meal in London, so I suggested we do Indian since 1. it is popular in London and 2. it is our favorite cuisine to eat. We arrived here on a Monday night at 8:00pm and were told an hour wait. We got in the line and were immediately brought complimentary chai tea while we waited. Once we made it to the front of the line we were invited to have drinks and snacks at the bar downstairs. This was after about 30 minutes of waiting outside. We sat at stools near the bar but decided to just wait until seated to order any alcohol. About 10 minutes after we moved downstairs, we were shown to our dining table. Our server was very knowledgeable and happily shared suggestions and recommendations. Everything is served family-style and the portions are smaller so it's recommended 4-5 dishes for 2 people. We started with the lamb samosas, which come 3 per order. The outside was crisp and the lamb was well-seasoned and plentiful inside. We ordered the mahi tikka, adwahi lamb, and the ruby chicken along with 2 orders of garlic naan. *Mahi tikka: this is sustainable Asian basa fillet in a subtle yoghurty marinade. This was a nice and light dish and tasted good with the extra lime. Even though this was good it was my least favorite and I let my husband eat most of it. *Adwahi lamb: The lamb is prepared with stock and spices, then layered with rice and cooked in traditional 'dum' style. This was deliciously spicy! Really generous portion too. The lamb was well seasoned and tender. *Ruby chicken: Tender chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce. This was my favorite dish! Very rich and flavorful and creamy. Best mopped up with garlic naan! Lots of tender, well-flavored chicken mixed in. *garlic naan: Some of the best garlic naan I've ever had! We ordered one order with butter and one without. I'm sure you can guess which was preferred at our table! The naan was soft and well-cooked and evenly flavored with garlic. When visiting London, Indian food is always a solid option and look no further than Dishoom to provide a 5 star dining experience! From getting in line until walking out the door, we both felt well-taken care of and that we were valued customers."
12/11/2021,5 star rating,Delicious and innovative. Stopped in here and was exhilarated by the taste and experience of Dishoom. Definitely recommend!
1/12/2021,5 star rating,"One of the best dining experiences we had on our trip to London. Get there early though, it's popular and lines do form to get in."
6/4/2018,4 star rating,"Had to wait outside but wasn't too bad and they hand you chai or mint tea while you wait. Probably waited 30 mins for a table for 4 on a Wednesday evening. For apps we shared be okra which was my favorite dish of the meal, shrimp, and bau bahji. Mains we had a chicken tikka masala type curry (was called something else but was similar to this) and a South Indian shrimp curry. Neither of these were mind blowing but still good. Their red chutney sauce was another highlight."
14/8/2017,5 star rating,I don't normally eat Indian food so I was a bit skeptical when my coworker said he wanted to come here. BUT this place was so good! I am so happy I came here. The line was long when we first got there but it moved up pretty quickly. Food: Okra Fries - Dishoom Calamari Lamb chops Dishoom Chicken Tikka Murgh Malai Kulfi Drinks: Moscow Mule and Kingfisher beer Everything was soooo delicious so it was difficult to choose a favorite but I think I liked the Okra Fries and Murgh Malai most. I would definitely come here again the next time I'm in London. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was also very nice. Price was pretty reasonable as well. Definitely recommend this place.
27/8/2017,4 star rating,"Located in bustling Covent Garden, Dishoom is likely the most popular Indian restaurant in all of London. 1. What is the restaurant like? Dishoom offers a nice ambience that caters to a diverse patron base: families, friend groups, and significant others on a special date. Upstairs and downstairs seating is available. 2. What is the wait like? On a Wednesday evening at 7:30 pm, we were quoted a 1 hr wait. We expected that we would have a chance to explore the area after putting our names down, but Dishoom requires that all customers wait in line. To placate hungry customers in line, the restaurant offers warm chai tea and small bites. 3. What should you order? According to our waiter, the restaurant's famed dishes are the chicken ruby, prawns, house black daal, and calamari. We ordered several dishes suggested by our waiter including the calamari, chicken ruby, house black daal, spicy lamb chops, bowl of greens, cheese naan, and garlic naan. The calamari was a nice starter that we enjoyed with the various dips, especially the spicy house sauce. Among the other plates we ordered, our favorite was the chicken ruby, which was pleasantly less creamy than the chicken tikka masala that we are accustomed to but loaded with just as much flavor. It served as the perfect accompaniment to the naan. We liked the other plates that we ordered, though we would have preferred the spicy lamb chops to have been cooked a tad less longer. Overall, we were extremely happy with our meal and left with content bellies. Dishoom was a fantastic first meal upon our arrival in London, and we would undoubtedly return."
18/8/2019,5 star rating,"I love Dishoom! I've been here once before a while back and was so excited to have the opportunity to eat here again. It definitely holds up! We got to Dishoom around 6pm and waited approximately 30 minutes to get inside for dinner. The line moved quite quickly and it was very nice that they provided mint tea and lemonade while we waited. Once inside, our waitress ran us through the menu and we ended up ordering garlic naan (£3.5), basmati rice (£3.20), chicken ruby (£10.90), paneer pineapple tikka (£8.70), house black daal (£6.50), and the vegetable samosas (£4.20). We also ordered an Aflatoon's Colada (£5.50) and passionfruit Sharbat (£3.90). This was plenty of food for the two of us and we even had some leftover. Everything was delicious! The chicken ruby is very similar to butter chicken, the house black daal was creamy and delicious, the paneer was not what I expected as I usually order it in a sauce, but delicious nonetheless, and the samosas were nice and crispy. The garlic naan and basmati rice were also perfect companions to the more flavorful food! In addition, the drinks we got were both fruity, unique and refreshing! Unfortunately, by the time our dinner was finished, there was no chai left. I'm not quite sure why that was the case, as it was only 8, but truly a huge disappointment!! Other than that, super delicious food and worth the wait!"
29/3/2019,5 star rating,"We really enjoyed the place. Great food, ambiance, and service. For those of you visiting London, you may hear constant recommendations for Dishoom which I feel may make it more of a ""trendy"" place, but it does deliver on delicious food quality. Apparently, it's a relatively newer bunch of restaurant that has expanded rapidly (thus seems to have filled a previously unmet demand for such a restaurant). First, there is a wait. Usually 45 minutes to an hour so plan accordingly. The Dishoom at this location is located in a great area with many shops so one could make some use of the time. The interior is large and with dark wood tones. Servers are professional and friendly. Food is great. The dishes are on the smaller size (think tapas). We had the Okra fries, cheese naan, masala prawns, chicken ruby, and spicy lamb chops. All were excellent. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. Overall, we were recommended to this restaurant by at least two people and I now pass on the recommendation. Check it out!"
18/7/2017,4 star rating,"It was my first time here and it is also my friend's favorite place.  We were early to beat the lines, so we had breakfast.  The atmosphere was very lively and open, very welcoming.  They have a downstairs as well that's a little more intimate.  The interior design is well put also - modern vs authenticity.   We both had the bacon naan roll and it was delish!  I had also ordered the fire toast, but it wasn't anything special.  Just toast, but the home-made preserves: pineapple-pink-peppercorn jam, and tangy orange marmalade with star anise was yummy! My friend really loved the dinner menu and wanted me to try AND only another 30 mins till dinner menu, soooooooooooooooooooooooo we decided to stay!!!!  We took our time eating and chatting.  I had ordered the house chai and that was great decision, plus free refills!!  The lassi with fennel was something else, quite refreshing.   When it was time to order, again, I ordered the Ruby chicken with rice....make that two!!!  We had the same thing again and it did not disappoint.  I truly enjoyed it.  Boy were we stuffed!  But good and satisfying stuffed.  I would love to come back again, but I'm 5600 miles away now! Thanks for the great experience!"
24/2/2018,4 star rating,"We tried the lamb samosas, chicken Ruby (a red curry), grilled prawns, a couple of cocktails, and garlic naan of course. It was good. The ambiance was good. Definitely a crowd favorite this one. At least I can say I've eaten Indian food while in London. But then again, I do believe I've eaten my fair share of really, really great Indian dishes in my neck of the woods (that is, Phoenix, Arizona). Go figure. This is a nice place to take your date to, but I imagine you'd be good enough to look for better, less expensive Indian places soon after that first date (if you and your companion hit it off and both appreciate Indian food at its best)."
31/5/2019,5 star rating,"If you're looking a Indian food with an awesome twist, go to dishoom. Pro: - the food (everything in the menu taste great!) - they serve you drinks (mint tea, chai, etc) as you wait in line - top notch service (they have a regular menu and a menu for people with dairy or nit allergies) Con: Beware there is a line. For two people we were estimated to wait for 1.5 hrs but we got in within an hour. So what to try: biryani, ruby curry, okra fries, garlic naan, daal! Everything tasted wonderful. Definitely worth the wait and the price is not too bad too."
26/2/2019,5 star rating,"So happy that we were able to have dinner at this lovely spot! Waited about an hour and a half.... and we read the reviews. We understand the hype and I still think this place is fantastic. If it makes it any easier, the servers offers hot chai tea to keep you warm in line. :) The meal was so lovely. We got a little bit of everything to try and although some dishes were spicy, it had a nice kick to it. My favorite dish is the chicken ruby, the very popular chicken dish, that tastes very much like Indian curry with big pieces of chicken. We also got the chicken and lamb dish, which were VERY flavorful and a tad bit salty, but when mixed in with rice, it is a great meal. We ordered the lentils (the black daahl) which isn't my favorite, but it does taste great when dipped with naan bread! We opted for a roti bread and a garlic naan which were both steaming when it came out and tasted heavenly dipped in sauce. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to try when in London! I wish they had a more updated system than having people wait in line.. but hey, it's a great marketing technique."
15/10/2019,5 star rating,"Simply fantastic! Dishes are small and you are intended to order many. Fragrant, fresh, delicious. We ordered off of the breakfast menu, it was so good we stayed for lunch as well. Chicken tikka=excellent! Service was top notch, friendly servers and helpful as well. The restaurant itself has a super cool vibe (especially in the lower level dining room). Absolutely will be coming back again!"
4/7/2017,4 star rating,"What a lunch feast to remember! Came here with a group of 10 for lunch a couple weeks ago and had the most amazing time. We had originally wanted to come for dinner, but couldn't get a a dinner reservation for any Dishoom in London! But lunch was excellent, and it's nice that they save a good chunk of their tables for walk-ins. Our server was very patient, kind, and attentive. She explained many dishes to us and gave us excellent recommendations. We ordered family style so I got to try a bit of everything. I had the: Rose & Cardamom Lassi: so good!!! Very refreshing and I loved the rose flavor. A perfect complement to all the spices. Cheese Naan: oh my gosh, so much cheesy goodness!!! The cheese was plentiful and beautifully melted and the naan had a nice moisture to it. Definitely wish we had ordered more of this. Chicken Ruby: yum!!!! This is so much less creamy and better than the chicken tikki masala I am used to getting in the States. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce was so delicious. Awadhi Lamb: some of my friends loved this, but It wasn't one of my favorites. The lamb flavor was a little too strong (does that even make sense?) for me. Keema Pau: same feelings as with the Awadhi--I just couldn't get behind the lamb here. Dishoom Slaw: a little too much sauce, but it was nice to have something to cool down my mouth. Bowl of Greens: greens! Yay! Simple bowls of vegetables that went well with all the sauce and meat we had. Black House Daal: people loved this dish, and they're known for making it. I personally thought it was too sweet. Okra Fries: reminded me of some Southern-fried food. A little too oily (but I always feel this way about fried vegetables), but nice to nibble on. Dishoom Calamari: this was delicious! Nice, light, a little sweet, and with the tiniest of kicks to get your senses going. Pau Bhaji: solid vegetarian dish. Loved the simple flavoring. Not as much of a fan of the bread, but that's probably because the Cheese Naan blew me away. Fantastic service, great ambiance, and very affordable prices. Can't wait to come back!"
2/3/2019,5 star rating,"A memorable dining experience and MUST DO when visiting London. They know how to do Indian food right. :) Made a reservation for 2 at 5:15 on a Friday night. Thanks goodness I did because the line wrapped around the block for daaays! Though my mom and I didn't have the emptiest stomachs for this early dinner, our waitress was kind as to help guide us through the menu (which is exhaustive). She did a perfect job of suggesting that we order 3-4 dishes, which were meant to be shared family style. Given our slightly full appetites, my mom and I ordered the dry-rub shrimp masala and chicken tikka (sp?) paired with a side of white rice and the classic naan. I was surprised to find out that my mom, who has a limited palette and low tolerance for spicy foods, actually enjoyed everything! She found all the flavors to be unique and interesting. The small family-style (sort of like tapas) portions were perfect for us and yet even, still a bit much as we had some leftovers. I also ordered the mango fennel lassi, which was delicious! Sometimes mango lassis can be a bit heavy on the yogurt and sugar, but I felt that the herb-essence from the fennel helped balance it all out. It also didn't hurt having this on the side as a chaser when the food got a bit spicy! For dessert, we had the chocolate fudge with cinnamon ice cream. My mom said she was in chocolate heaven! The chocolate was warm and gooey and paired well with the cool ice cream. Just decadent! Ambience was lovely with the trendy Indian, family home character vibes that this gives off! A lovely and lively place to grab dinner with anyone. Would definitely come back to try more on the menu next time I visit London."
23/2/2019,2 star rating,"Yes, I was one of those Americans tricked by the 1500+ reviews, so I stood in line outside for an hour. The food, by no means, was bad but most certainly not 4.5 stars worthy. We ordered the garlic naan, which barely consisted of any bread..it was mostly air inside. Also, it had little to no garlic flavor. My boyfriend got their special coconut curry and the sauce was soooo WATERY. Wouldn't call it a curry; but rather a soup. I ordered the chicken tikka, and it was too sweet/tomato-y tasting for my preference. I honestly expected a lot more from this place especially with the amount of people waiting outside. Clearly, you guys have not been exposed to divine Indian food!!!"
21/6/2017,5 star rating,"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. Came upon this place through a recommendation and was very pleased to have the opportunity to check it out. Went for a late dinner and arrived around 9:25pm. Even at that hour there was a line 30 minutes deep, but the wait didn't seem so bad as the friendly staff handed out complimentary fruit (grapes and dates) and drinks (chai and mint teas). Upon getting to the front of the line, you are given a buzzer and directed downstairs to the bar, where you can order drinks and snacks while you wait. Got the Bollybellini, a tasty fruity concoction, and waited no more than a few moments until the host seated us. They were more than accommodating when my companion and I wanted to switch to a different (read: bigger) table. Our server Ali was as friendly as could be and even gave us some great recommendations/suggestions. Between us two, we got the vegetable samosas to start (which we ended up getting an extra order of halfway through our meal -- yes, it was THAT good!) along with the Dishoom chicken tikka, spicy lamb chops, Butter-Bhatta, the Black House Daal, garlic naan, and steamed basmati rice. I could have just gotten the Daal with basmati rice and I would have been a happy camper, tbh. But really, everything was delicious and very flavorful! The garlic naan could have used a little more garlic flavor, but other than that, everything was superb! Aside from the great food and very attentive, helpful and friendly staff, the prices are reasonable. I would note that this place is more on the trendy side and the size of the dishes are similar to tapas style. Would definitely come back here the next time I'm in London! Already itching to try the Chicken Ruby and the Mahi Tikka. Again, Ali was an amazing server if you're lucky to get him, and really the whole staff was just top notch!!"
20/2/2020,5 star rating,"We dined here after many recommendations from friends far and wide.  Locals and tourists both see this one as a favorite.  The entrance can be a little daunting.  There is a hostess outside you check in with and then wait in an outdoor line.  Then you are brought downstairs to the bar area to have cocktails and wait.  The wait was long but well worth it.  We dined on everything our server recommended and more.  It was my first time trying Indian food and I loved it!  The service was quick as they are used to taking care of many people at once and the food was delicious.  It is tapas style so I would recommend 2 items per person, and to share family style."
12/6/2017,4 star rating,"I didn't think Indian food would one of my favorite meals in London, but it was! Dishoom is London's first Bombay cafe, and it lives up to the hype. My friends and I arrived around Dishoom on an afternoon around 2 PM, and luckily, we only had to wait about 30 minutes. We ordered the following: - Pau Bhaji (mashed vegetables with pau buns) - This was our appetizer to start, and it was delicious! It was flavorful with a slightly spicy kick, and it came with hot buttered buns to dip in the mashed veggies. - Spicy lamb chops - Deliciously spiced and well-cooked! The lamb was tender yet crispy on the edges, and it didn't taste gamey at all to me! - Dishoom Chicken Tikka - Chicken tikka is one of my favorite Indian dishes, so we had to try this. It was a little sweeter than I expected, but still good nonetheless. - House black daal - This was like a thick and hearty lentil soup. Creamy with great flavors. - Plain naan, garlic naan, cheese naan - Naan is a MUST at any Indian restaurant. They were all good, though the cheese was interesting since it's not a traditional naan flavor. I do wish the garlic naan tasted more garlicky and the cheese naan had more cheese though. - Roomali roti - The roti was recommended to us to pair with the chicken. I didn't think the roti was anything too special though. Texture-wise, it was like a super thin tortilla. I preferred pairing all the dishes with the naan. - Yogurt - Another recommendation from the waiter. This helped cut some of the intensity of the otherwise strong flavors of the other dish, so I thought it was a nice balance. - House sauces - The waiter brought out 3 house chutneys/dipping sauces (tamarind, mint, sweet chili?), which were delicious. The chili one paired REALLY well with the naan and other dishes - so much so that was had to ask for more! We also ordered the Bombay presidency punch to share (a bowl of jaggery, lime, Darjeeling tea and Ceylon Arrack), and it was amazing! It may be a bit dangerous, since it tastes so good and refreshing that you might just forget it's alcoholic. Our waiter actually forgot to put our order in until we asked halfway through our meal. By the time we got it, we were almost done eating, we so just sat there a while sipping some ""punch."" Overall, it was a fun, delicious, and flavorful meal with great ambiance and excellent service too! If you're in the area, I'd recommend having a meal here!"
12/6/2019,5 star rating,"Dishoom is a PHENOMENAL restaurant, especially for brunch. I was impressed by every single thing I ordered including the teas. My favorite was the Bacon Naan Roll, which I recommend to everyone whenever I hear London or food. The Bacon Naan Roll is so flavorful and all of the ingredients compliment each other so well. The first bite I took of the Bacon Naan Roll I immediately ordered two more."
17/3/2019,5 star rating,"I have to say, I am Indian and I love the name. The food is a unique twist on Indian. The names of the dishes are clever and the rustic feel sets for a time back in India. Chicken Tikka dish is very aromatic and hits all the right notes. The roomali roti is super thin and sets for a great meal too. The okra fries are tender and lightly battered. The food isn't Indian spicy like I would have wanted but the flavors are all there. Their rose lychee shake is great too! Great job!"
23/9/2017,5 star rating,"Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 83/100 We decided we should have at least one Indian meal in London before going home so we found this restaurant on Yelp (thank you!!). We arrived around 7:45 and the wait was a full hour, outdoors. They serve you a nice warm chai tea while waiting, which was lovely. I really wasn't sure what to expect as we peered through the windows watching people eat. It looked rather crowded from the outside peeking in but it's actually huge and there's a whole bottom floor with more seating. I took one bite of the curry and completely understood why people wait an hour out in the cold and rain to eat at this place. It was hands down the best curry I've had anywhere in the world, including India and Thailand. I'm usually pretty good at guessing ingredients in dishes but I had no idea what they put in here to make it so amazing. The rest of the food was also very good, including the lentils, which I don't usually like. The lentils had a nice texture, not mushy like what I've had in the past. If we had more time in London, I would have come back here just to eat the curry again- it was that good."
30/1/2019,3 star rating,"Extremely overrated. Don't be a silly American and wait in the cold for one hour. Hop in an Uber and go a bit further out to Original Lahore Kebab House in Whitechapel for some great South Asian grub. I feel like those giving this place five stars have had limited Indian food experiences. Dishoom has a great menu in the sense they're small plates, so you can sample a variety of foods in one meal. The only issue is the food quality doesn't warrant the wait time. We waited one hour (yes, they give you complimentary chai tea while you're waiting, but only after you've waited about 40 minutes already) for this experience. I wanted to order dishes I did not have easy access to back home, including jackfruit biryani, spicy prawns, and cheese naan to name a few. Decent flavor and quick service, but not an exceptional experience. We capped our meal with a rose and chamomile lassi, which was refreshing. Prices are standard for London. If you had to pick between this or unseasoned fried food, I'd absolutely pick Dishoom. But, in a city with such a large Indian population, there is a plethora of other options."
21/4/2017,5 star rating,"Mmm, this place truly deserves all the hype that it gets! Hands down the best restaurant I went to in London. Two friends and I ordered the garlic naan, roti, chicken tikka masala, black house dal, chicken ruby, lamb and vegetable samosas, a bowl of greens, and a few sides of basmati rice. I also got the Bombay colada - one of the most unique and tasty drinks I've ever had. A little spicy and super refreshing with a good kick. All the food was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable; our waitress was chatty and funny and recommended several of the above dishes to us. Moving on to the main dishes - so impressed! Out of all the entrees, I would recommend the dal the most - very meaty and flavorful. The chicken dishes were incredibly tangy and spicy (ask them to tone down the spice if you're not into that). The garlic naan was warm and buttery and absolutely delicious! As was the roti - it absorbed the flavor of the previous dishes well and came with three very tasty sauces. Great samosas (I liked the vegetable more than the lamb) and uniquely crunchy / salty / flavorful greens. Overall everything was very very good and prices were reasonable, especially for London. It's a fun place to eat with a lot of people since dishes are pretty small - grab some friends and try out a bunch of things! Oh, and make a reservation in advance - it gets super busy. Breakfast and lunch hours are less crowded so that may be a better option!"
8/6/2017,4 star rating,"Our party of four came around on a Saturday at around 6, expecting a wait. The line didn't look too long but in reality, it was a 1.5 hour wait. Their waiting system is actually pretty orderly. It's like getting into a nightclub. They have ropes (non-velvet) and have people line up. I'm not sure if this is just to make it look like it's poppin', because there were quite a few empty tables inside. Maybe they were for people who made reservations (only available for groups of 6+). While you're waiting, a waitress comes around and gives you small samples of hot chai tea latte. It was a bit too sweet for me, but it was a very nice gesture, especially since it was windy and chilly that day. Finally, once you get inside the exclusive Dishoom, you'll wait about 15 more minutes while they prepare your table. That's how they get you to order a drink at the bar downstairs. So I had the Chilitini (Luksusowa vodka with pomegranate, lemon juice and chilli liqueur) and for 7.50, it was pretty inexpensive for a cocktail (compared to NYC, anyway). I really liked the flavor and the bite that the chili liquer gave it, but I wish there was a bit more vodka in it. I guess I'm just used to stronger NYC cocktails, where they don't measure out the liquor. Onto the food. Here is what we ordered: Garlic Naan - our waiter recommended two orders for four people, but I'm glad that we didn't go with his suggestion. It was very oily, so it would have been difficult for one person to eat more than a certain amount of it. Could have used more garlic. Lamb Boti Kabab (pieces of tender lamb marinated with red chilli, garlic and ginger) - the flavor was good but the lamb was pretty dry. It definitely needed some sauce with it. House Black Daal (Indian spiced lentils) - this was like a soupy bean dip. Not my favorite but it went well with the garlic naan Chicken Ruby (chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce) - this was probably the star of the show, as it seems like the majority here would agree. The sauce is great (again, especially with the naan), and the chicken wasn't dry. Note - none of the 'entrees' come with any sides so you'll want to order naan or rice to go with it. The portions are on the smaller side so it's best to order a bunch of dishes and just share them. That way, you'll get to have a great variety. I don't know how packed their other locations get. I also don't know if I would wait another 1.5 hours to eat here again. But I do know that it was a great London Indian food experience."
30/3/2021,5 star rating,"A superb restaurant, we look forward to going there again when things reopen in London. This place had rave reviews"
20/5/2017,4 star rating,An inviting window into Parsi culture. Eating here was a pleasant experience. We arrived late on a weeknight and the restaurant was still packed when we got there. The Art Deco flourishes give the space the feel of another time and place. The kabobs were meaty and well spiced. We also ordered biryani. The rice was aromatic and complemented the meat dishes nicely. Would also recommend the roti.
28/3/2017,4 star rating,"Last year, Dishoom was named as the best restaurant in Britain according to Yelp. Unsurprisingly, the wait at this Bombay-inspired café averages an hour. While it is quite long, they do offer hot tea (chai and mint) as you queue up. Grab a glass - it'll come in handy as the chilly evening sets in. It's also both free and delicious, so there really isn't any reason not to. For being such a casual place with a reasonably priced menu, the ambiance here is quite upscale. To boot, the attentive waiters running around with smiles on their faces make for great service. They bang those dishes out blazing fast. I received my order within 10 minutes of placing it. On the flip side, I think that the food here is a tad overhyped. While they do serve very solid Indian fare, I was not quite blown away as I hoped. Per my server's recommendation, I ordered the Chicken Ruby, the House Black Daal, and the Garlic Naan. All very good, none particularly outstanding. What actually wowed me the most was the mint & coriander sauce that was served on the side as a dip. That stuff was to-die for, so make sure you at least give it a taste! **UPDATE** Since writing my review, I've been to Dishoom several times more, trying both their breakfast and all-day menus. Here's the lowdown on everything I've tasted. Breakfast: Bacon Naan Roll (£5.90) - 5 stars Bacon & Egg Naan Roll (£5.20) - 5 stars Big Bombay (£11.90) - 4 stars Appetizers: Pau Bhaji (£4.50) - 5 stars Okra Fries (£4.50) - 5 stars Vegetable Samosas (£4.20) - 3 stars Entrees: Jackfruit Biryani (£9.50) - 5 stars Mahi Tikka (£8.70) - 4 stars Murgh Malai (£8.50) - 4 stars Masala Prawns (£11.90) - 4 stars Sali Boti (£12.50 half / £16.90 full) - 4 stars Dishoom Chicken Tikka Roll (£7.50) - 4 stars Chicken Ruby (£10.50) - 3 stars House Black Daal (£6.20) - 3 stars Awadhi Lamb Biryani (£11.50) - 3 stars Dishoom Chicken Tikka (£8.50) - 3 stars Sides: Cheese Naan (£3.70) - 5 stars Garlic Naan (£3.20) - 4 stars Plain Naan (£2.90) - 4 stars Raita (£3.20) - 4 stars Drinks: House Chai (£2.70) - 5 stars Chocolate Chai (£3.20) - 4 stars Viceroy's Old-Fashioned (£9.50) - 4 stars Rose & Cardamom Lassi (£3.90) - 4 stars Mango & Fennel Lassi (£3.90) - 3 stars Desserts: Bun Maska Pudding (£5.60) - 4 stars Pistachio Kulfi on a Stick (£3.70) - 2 stars"

20/5/2022,4 star rating,"chicken & jackfruit biryani are both really flavorful for what is mostly rice. paneer curry was good. broccoli salad was okay but idk how flavorful you could make raw broccoli. jackfruit was good but tasted like fruit, not a meat substitute. garlic naan was fine."
18/5/2019,4 star rating,"I had been to Dishoom many years ago, didn't know they did breakfast but a quick internet search taught me that they are super popular for breakfast and with good reason! We made a reservation for 9.15 am online for a Saturday morning and it was fully seated. However, we took our good time to enjoy the super delicious bacon naan, egg naan and Keema Per Eedu - a fantastic chicken dish, beautifully spiced and I drank liters of the House Chai. By far the best Chai I ever had! The service was prompt and friendly, the atmosphere relaxed and classy without being pompous. Highly recommended if you wanted something a bit different for breakfast!"

22/3/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing food. Amazing spices. Amazing taste. This is the best traditional Indian food I've had in London. They're also everywhere! The line is usually out the door, but it's definitely worth going to because of the atmosphere, people, heartiness, and delicious food. There are many twists and accents the head chef spins on their meals, and I think the addition of personal touches is what makes this place so spectacular. My favorite dishes are the Chicken Ruby as well as the Morgh Malai.. and make sure to order the garlic or cheese naan with your meal! This is an amazing place to go to if you're ever in London, in fact, you MUST go. I will be upset if you didn't (not that my opinion matters, I'm just a yelp reviewer)."
16/2/2017,4 star rating,"Gotta be honest..I'm not a fan of Indian food. Never was. While planning a trip to London...I was INFORMED multiple times that the Indian food in London was THE BEST. That I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO TRY IT. Ok..I reluctantly agreed to give it a try. Dishoom, according to our radar, was one of THE top Indian food restaurants. So...Dishoom it was! When we arrived, there was a mini line but it moved fairly fast (10-15 mins tops). We were offered some chai tea while we waited...interesting taste indeed. We were quickly moved into the basement where the bar was...not much seating but packed and cozy. Onto our food. We decided to yolo it and order pretty much one from each section. Great decisions made that night ;)!! GARLIC NAAN 2.20 -soft and fluffy naan bread with garlic flavors floating out while you eat. GET IT! STEAMED BASMATI RICE 2.20-typical rice..I got it mixed up with the yellow rice...but this does pair well with the curry dishes. OKRA FRIES 3.70 -deep fried and a tad oily. PAU BHAJI 3.90-super soft warm buns meant to be dipped in this veggie paste?...it was mouthwateringly tasty. GUNPOWDER POTATOES 5.90-chunks of potatoes mixed with spices and a hint of lime juice. It was a lifesaver when we got hungry in the middle of the night and decided to eat the leftovers. CHICKEN RUBY 8.2-not your typical curry flavor. I can't remember the exact taste but it was very flavorful. All the food we ate was delicious and the price point was perfect. I would def go again. Must try in London!"
30/5/2019,5 star rating,"There was an hour wait, and I was pretty reluctant to wait. I'm normally not a fan of higher end restaurants, especially ones with a line. They asked that at least one member of your party is in line at all times, so it's easy to swap out and explore the area. The food was amazing!! It was flavorful, spicy, and savory. We got at least 7 different dishes, and I wasn't disappointed with any of them. I really liked the chutney sauce. The hostess was very attentive and kind. I think she had red hair with a non British accent. Her recommendations for foods, cocktails, and amount to order was all spot on. I would definitely come back. Edit: went back again, and it's still amazing. If you're overwhelmed with the menu, just get the ones that are boxed out on the menu. Can't go wrong with those."

8/7/2017,4 star rating,"This was a place I had bookmarked for dinner one night but ended up not going until we wanted breakfast this morning and this place was recommended. My fiancé is not a fan of Indian food so that was another reason we didn't come here for dinner. We did walk by on a Friday night and there was a queue to get in and it seemed like quite a long one. Anyway, I ordered a chocolate chai since it was a little brisk this morning. It was perfectly warm and it had all the aromas that you would look for in a chai... if drinks could give you a warm fuzzy hug, this drink would be the one to do it. For our meals, we went with the naan wraps with egg. I got the sausage one and he got bacon (extra crispy). While it was good, it was not anything to write home to. His bacon was not crispy to start with - maybe some burnt edges. I gave him half of my sausage naan roll and I got half of his bacon naan roll. I want to come back here for dinner one day as I really enjoy Indian food. In the meantime, I will have to convince Brian's tastebuds that they like Indian food."
3/1/2019,3 star rating,"My friend and I went to Dishoom on our first night in London. We got there around 8pm on a Saturday night and there was a line out the door. They don't take reservations so you're literally stuck waiting in line until they call you. I've heard London has pretty good Indian food and this place was highly reviewed, so we didn't mind waiting. It took about an hour or so before we got seated downstairs. After browsing the menu, we decided on the okra fries, the chicken ruby, and the paneer tikka. We got our food pretty quickly, and from what I remember, nothing stood out. The okra fries were the best part of the meal, but they still weren't memorable. The chicken ruby was alright, the chicken was a bit dry imo. The paneer tikka I could've done without. All the food was just meh. For a place that has such high reviews and praises I was quite disappointed. I don't think I'd come back here when I come back to London."
15/4/2017,5 star rating,"Wow this place is popular! Every time we walked by there was a line out the door! We came around 8/9pm on a weekday and it was about a hour wait. I liked that the wait seemed fair (followed the sequence in which people arrived) and they handed out hot tea while waiting. If you are waiting outside in line, they eventually move you to the bar where you may wait another 15-30 minutes. Luckily the food was worth the wait! We had their house dal and chicken ruby with rice and naan. This was one of my fiancés first Indian food experiences so I told him if he did not like the food here then he would probably not like Indian food anywhere. Thankfully we both loved it! For dessert we had the chocolate pudding with vanilla chili ice cream. They were definitely the perfect complement to each other as I don't think I'd enjoy the chili flavor of the ice cream without the richness of the pudding. I'd highly recommend coming here!"

26/12/2018,4 star rating,"First off they have out chai and other teas as you wait outside. And their chai is actually amazing unlike other places who serve chai. They're cocktail menu looked tempting but we stuck with the food only. We ordered paneer (classic) and dhal makhani, also delicious. The garlic naan was on point as well. I can see why this is a very popular Indian restaurant in London. If I come back, I'm definitely getting more tea."
21/11/2021,4 star rating,If you like Indian food but are wary of the consistently great reviews (and long lines at some of their locations) - come here! The food is worth it!
16/4/2019,4 star rating,"Really good Indian food with great cocktails. We came in after shopping at Covent Garden in the afternoon, we didn't have to experience any long waits as we were seated immediately. We had several of their mainstays including CHicken Ruby Curry, Black Daal, lamb biryani. Those dishes were really good. Especially the biryani, that dish packed a ton of flavor into that little bowl. I loved it. And of coourse we sopped everyhting up with some garlic naan. I'd suggest bring a group of people and order a bunch of stuff, the portiosn aren't the biggest, but they are flavorful and interesting. My favorite thing that I had at dishoom was actually their cocktail their Hoppy Butter Paanch. Oh wow, what a surprising cocktail, it has a IPA hop foam, and then underneath that it has a whisky and honey based cocktail with some spices, but when you drink it. it doesn't taste like any of those ingredients listed, it's an ultra smooth cocktail taht doesn't taste like beer or whisky, it does have some spices to it, but it's like a smooth punch kicked up with a hint of spices and it's so refreshing, I would prolly kill a gallon of this on a hot summer day, but seeing as it was 30 degrees outside I only had 2 of them. The other cocktails were good too but i just can't get over how good that hoppy butter paanch is."
25/10/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing! Not sure how any negative reviews because the food was delicious. Highly recommend the okra fries and the Ruby chicken (chicken tikka masala).

1/6/2019,5 star rating,"This was our favorite meal in two weeks in Ireland/UK. The commitment to quality is unparalleled especially at this price point. The flavors are mouthwatering and impossible to replicate at home. The service is too notch. We would return often if we lived locally! Specific examples: Quality: a manager observed (with no promting from us) that one of our tikka masala pieces from the grill was burned and replaced it with a new full portion. We only had two pieces left and hadn't noticed. Communication: told us the wait of 20 mins (was way less) and instructed us directions to the bar downstairs, then greeted us by our name at the bottom. Then since they knew we planned to order lunch, let us know the timing of that before the kitchen transitioned from breakfast to lunch. Multiple people with staff also double checked that my husband indeed did not need sugar with his cappuccino when they noticed none at our table, and complimented his health choice haha."
25/5/2017,5 star rating,"See my tip - for lines. Amazing food. Came for dinner and enjoyed an array of amazing food.  I wasn't a huge Indian food lover, but that's because we get a different version in the Western world.  I'd recommend asking your helpful server for suggestions - many sections have highlighted dishes and we ordered all of them to try.  The cocktails were fresh and yummy as well with a nice wine selection by the glass.  However , we did order the naan garlic bread, followed by the cheese naan ‼Save room for dessert - the chocolate custard was divine.   Part II- breakfast was a no wait / walk in at 10am!  We had the bacon naan and chai tea which was amazing!!"

Trust me. It's worth it!!! I hated Indian food and I'm very picky about strong smells, but this restaurant was amazing. It smelled divine. Wow. Wow. WOW. I am officially obsessed with this restaurant. Wow. WOW. Wow. Get the Okra fries! Get the Garlic Naan and the regular naan. Get the Dishoom Chicken Tikka! You should also get the Black Daal & Ruby Chicken Curry. Honestly, just order the entire menu. If I was in London right now, I would."
2/3/2019,5 star rating,"This was an amazing dinner. When we first got to the restaurant we ordered wine and the potato crisps while waited. They told us the wait was an hour fifteen but we waited like 45 minutes. Then we had lamb samosa, lamb kabob, the lamb special, chicken ruby and garlic naan. The chicken ruby is BY FAR one of the most amazing things. Next time I come I'm not sharing and just getting the chicken ruby with some garlic naan and rice lol!! For dessert we had the chocolate pudding, which was really nice. I would have liked a little extra ice cream. Can't wait to come back!! Thanks Dishoom!!"
7/8/2017,5 star rating,"WOW! Simply WOW. This is a intense, yet refined and polished Indian experience. The food was nothing short of world class. Service? AMAZING.  Drinks, although I didn't think Indians were well known for their alcohol, we really spectacular. This place was DEFINITELY one of the highlights of our trip to london. When we return to Europe, I will ensure that Dishoom is a possibility for one of our stops. Can I give more than 5 stars?"
24/3/2019,5 star rating,"We ate here and it was fantastic !!!! The wait can be long so plan ahead.  We got chicken ruby (our favorite ). , nan, murghalimali, raita was good too.  We also had the corn on the cob which was good All in all it was great !!!!!!! It is worth the wait and the prices are quite reasonable really for what you get.   The Dishoom IPA beer was good too."
30/12/2019,5 star rating,"I was so happy to find this Indian restaurant. The food was delicious, prices are reasonable and they serve thumbs up! Yes be prepared to wait in line for about an hour or so but it is well worth it. They take reservations so I highly suggest that you make one before heading over and have various locations. The chicken Ruby was my favorite, the chutney so yummy and spicy and the decor just makes it an experience!!!"
15/8/2019,5 star rating,"Fantastic flavors and dishes. I got the macchi tikka, fried green chilies, gunpowder potatoes and would definitely recommend any of them. The house chai was great. Also be sure to get the cheese naan. Venue was nice and decorative, would highly recommend."
25/1/2019,5 star rating,This place is a MUST when visiting London. Food was great! Service was quick! Atmosphere is nice. Highly recommend! **
13/3/2019,5 star rating,"Yes, the stories about the line are true, but yes, it is worth it. They don't take reservations for parties smaller than 6 people after 6 PM. So either make a reservation and go early, or plan to go with a large group! Or, submit to standing outside in the cold with a cup of chai to keep you warm. Dishoom knows how popular it is and they have a seamless system to accommodate the large demand. The staff are all kind and understanding and help to get people inside to the bar as soon as possible. Once inside, the cocktails should not be ignored. The drink menu is extensive and, honestly, fun to read. Tried the bollybellini and their spin on a mojito. Both delicious and refreshing. When we were finally seated, we were given a helpful walk through of the menu with great advice on what to order. In the end for the 4 of us, we got 2 starters: Prawn Koliwada and Okra Fries, and 4 dishes: Murgh Malai (chicken), Gunpowder Potatoes, Awadhi Lamb Biryani, the House Black Daal, plus 2 sides: Plain Naan and the Dishoom Slaw. Sounds like a lot, but it was the perfect amount to taste and share. We were warned that the Biryani would be spicy. It was flavorful, but not painfully spicy at all. We had a great meal with warm ambiance. A bit noisy and crowded, but not a problem. While we were waiting to be seated, we were annoyed with all of the people hogging tables without yielding them to the long line outside. Yet, by the time we were seated, we also didn't want to leave."
30/5/2017,5 star rating,"Get here early if you don't want to wait long for a table! We got here at 545pm and there was already a line. While you're in line, they give complimentary tea. We were given a wait time of 40 minutes. What's amazing is that once a spot opens at the bar, they let you wait there and you have the chance to order appetizers and drinks while you wait for your table. Luckily, our wait time was way shorter than they said and we got seated in 20 minutes! We had vada pav, calamari, and samosas as appetizers. For entrees we had two orders of the chicken curry, and order of daal, and the lamb biryani. Everything was absolutely delicious! My favorite dish was definitely the chicken curry. The curry itself reminds me of tikka masala because it's rich and creamy. The chicken was very tender. Great service, great food, and great atmosphere."
16/10/2021,4 star rating,NIce Food. I went with my friends & Family few weeks ago to celebrate my birthday. It was really nice experience. The food was very delicious. Looking forward to visit again.
18/5/2017,5 star rating,"I heard from several friends who recommended this place, and now I know why! Dishoom was absolutely delicious, and even though I don't really eat Indian food, I love the food here! Food: 5/5! Actually all of the dishes were delicious, not a single one fell short. We had the okra fries and calamari, and both were fried perfectly, but very oily. Okra fries were almost like yam fries! The chicken tikka was good, but not spectacular. The lamb kebabs were better I think, but personally not a huge fan of lamb. The lamb biryani was one of my faves! The rice is amazingly blended with different flavours, and we added Raita to it too (felt almost like chicken over rice. We also ordered a bowl of greens which was actually very good and helped balance out the heavy meat dishes. I highly recommend the garlic naan and the matter paneer, those were the other highlights of the night. Drinks wise I really liked the mango lassi, and it was a perfect balance for all the spicy and oily dishes. If you're in London this is definitely a must try!"
13/4/2022,5 star rating,delicious food. you can't make dinner reservations and have to wait in line but it is so worth it. excellent service as well!
24/11/2018,5 star rating,Really enjoyed the dinner I had here recently with my boyfriend. We were stopping in to fuel up in between bars and the food was great! We ordered a lot of food and it was all delivered quickly. And the drinks are also top-notch - I had the Viceroy's Old Fashioned and enjoyed it quite a bit. I was also really impressed with the efficiency with which they managed the queue outside and got everyone seated promptly. I don't remember all we ordered but know for sure we got the gunpowder potatoes and lamb samosas and both were excellent.
14/3/2021,5 star rating,Overall fantastic India and great for a group meal. I've eaten here several times and have always enjoyed the experience.
21/4/2019,5 star rating,So delicious! We waited about an hour but it's definitely worth it. Someone in line told us to order the chicken berry Britannia and Raita. Those two together were perfect.
12/1/2019,4 star rating,"The secret to queuing outside a restaurant is making sure that you like the people that you go with. I kind of resent queuing because I don't like following everyone, but I'm happy to be patient for decent food. Also, they manage it well and keep well stocked. Queuing isn't a great grand novelty in London, and they keep you watered. The breakfast naan, and garlic naan are great, berry Britannia, black daal, vada pav and a couple of recommendations, which were, of course excellent (especially the okra fries). Ooh and Chili cheese toast- I just love cheese okay. The staff are lovely, the food is also lovely, the atmosphere is nice and bustle-y- but not the best for hard of hearing"
30/1/2020,5 star rating,"One of the best meals ever, in my life!  The wait was long and it was raining(Dishoom provides umbrellas) but completely worth it!  Don't miss out, next time in London eat here!"
21/9/2018,5 star rating,"We came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. We were starving, but decided to wait here because of the amazing reviews. The staff came out with Chai for those waiting in line which is a very nice touch. We were given a wait time of about 40 mins but were let inside to wait at the downstairs bar in under 15 and then seated about 10 mins later. We ordered all the suggested: Pau bhaji - mildly spicy and full of flavor - SO GOOD, MUST GET! Chicken ruby this dish was very good, I wasn't blown away by it as much as the pau bhaji, but it was still worth the order. Black daal -  I was surprised by how much flavor this dish had since it's just ""stewed black beans"" but it's very good. I'm not a HUGE fan of daal in general, but they season it very well. The bollybellini cocktail was delicious, I could have had 3 more if i wasn't so full from the food we ordered! Calamansi smash I thought it was acceptable in comparison to the other, but my boyfriend really loved it. I forgot the name of our server, but he was only on his 4th day serving and was absolutely amazing! He was friendly and very on top of everything. Checked up on us regularly and was never too far. I think he was from Spain? Anyway, the reviews aren't overly hyped, this place is legit and you have to make time to stop here."
8/9/2018,5 star rating,"Came by Dishoom for lunch. They take reservations for lunch and breakfast, but not dinner. Definitely recommended to make a reservation - it's really easy on their website, and there is almost always a line when coming in. Easiest/most painless way to get a table here is to make a reservation for lunch, and breeze right in past the long line forming by the door. Service is polite but somewhat curt and rushed given the amount of people there are coming through. There is a very large downstairs seating area, and the booths have fun fans that cool you down from the spice. Their menu is huge with a variety of dishes from across India. Most of the dishes are sized and made to share, and the back has a large drinks and chai menu. The drinks are very small portions. Lassi is thick and yogurty, and the chai comes creamy and sweet. Favorite dishes: House Black Daal: Amazing, very spicy and creamy. Chole Poori - chickpea curry with a very interesting pairing of sweet halwa mash, comes with puffy poori bread. Delicious must have. Paneer: their paneer dishes are delicious, all well flavored with chewy paneer. The mattar paneer came in a sauce that was very tomato-y, and had very few peas."
13/9/2016,5 star rating,"1. Service- very attentive and friendly. Both times I came here, I had two different servers, and they were both very professional. They were very welcoming and they made sure you had everything you needed. It's A-La-Carte, so wait to be seated, order and pay at the table. 2. Price- this place is affordable, and not expensive at all. For two people, you'll pay about £30, but that depends on how much you order though. 3. Ambiance- modern and hip. There are two stories to this particular restaurant. I guess you can say there is a Ground level and a Lower Ground Level. Or perhaps as we better understand in the states, 1st floor and a basement. Haha. Dress code is casual. 4. Food- we had cheese naan, Gunpowder potatoes, Chicken Ruby, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and Vegetable Biryani. My favorite were the potatoes, and the Tikka. Everything was very flavorful and I have to say, it's the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to. 5. Cleanliness- superb. I can't complain."
14/3/2019,4 star rating,"Me and my wife were looking for a breakfast spot and we happened to stumble a upon this place. As we walked in it smelled of everything delicious. Lol. There was fresh naan being cooked and the the Indian spices was just oh so good. We both decided in the Big Engilsh style Indian breakfast. Which was a great idea  because we were both hungry and we need the energy for the day of tours. It cam with Indian style eggs, which is scrambled with some spices, very delicious.. 2 bangers and 2 slices of bacon, a small bowl of baked beans and 2 buns. Everything was so good and it was sooo filling. We also wanted to try the naan so we ordered a bacon and egg naan. We saw them making it in there big tandoori oven which was soo cool. The naan-wich was very good as well. The naan was very soft and light and yet soo crispy. With the filling and the naan it was just a great combo."
19/12/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing simply amazing. So first off - get here early. The line is pretty long and there's not a lot of cover for you if it rains. The service here is amazing and the food comes out to you very quickly. Our waitress was also super polite and was very helpful in choosing plates. We had a multitude of dishes and the review would be too long of I only listed it all but something's that stood out were the chicken ruby, vegetable samosas, and the chocolate pudding. The chicken ruby was creamy soft, and went well with the garlic naan. The samosas were also pretty good and went well with the dipping sauce. The chocolate pudding tasted like a dream and the chili ice cream brought out the sweetness of the pudding."
22/9/2019,5 star rating,"On holiday here in London and looked on Yelp to see where we should eat at, this place came up as #1, plus we drove/ walked by multiple times in the past couple days and there has been a line around the building and down the street. We came at 7Pm and had an hour and twenty minute wait..... let me just tell you it was worth every second! The staff that greets you outside is so sweet and they even brought our hot chai tea out to you while waiting. Once you get next up or close to being sat they take you to the full bar downstairs which is gorgeous and the staff was incredible. We only waited a few minutes by the bar before getting sat in a large booth. We  started off with Lamb Samosas- which i was a little hesitant on... but wanted to order seconds!!! I had the chicken Ruby which was wonderful, along with the garlic naan! Soooooo good. My bf has the chef special which i didn't even get a chance to try because he was already licking the plate clean! Incredible flavors, incredible staff, amazing dining experience, and even better atmosphere ! Loved every minute!"
27/6/2016,5 star rating,"Dishoom was our first stop in London for dinner and well worth the wait. With 700+ reviews already here, I'll give you a rundown of what stood out to me most. 1) The line outside snaked around and around, but they sweetened the experience with hot chai tea and sherry. Once you get inside, you *may* think your wait is over but instead, you're transported downstairs to the bar area. We had enough time to get a drink and apps there. Our total wait time was about an hour but these little extras made it fly by. 2) We ordered okra fries and lamb samosas at the bar, then Dishoom's signature dish (and vegetarian) house black daal, curry-infused chicken ruby, and garlic naan at our table. There's nothing I would not recommend. 3) I love how Indian restaurants offer an array of non-alcoholic drinks that are delicious like laasis, and Dishoom takes that one step further with teas, coffees, and sodas. That being said, I still went with some cocktails including the super refreshing Bollybellini and classic Bombay Pimm's. 4) I truly enjoyed reading the menu and learned that the restaurant donates a free lunch to schools in India for every meal you eat at Dishoom. 5) I would've come back here time and time again (including for breakfast!) if I had more time in London. There are heaps of other dishes I need to try. So there ya have it. Believe the hype. Love the hype. Taste the hype."
7/10/2019,5 star rating,"Is there a better place in London for breakfast?  I think any conversation on the subject has to include any of the Dishoom locations in a discussion of the final three (please send me your favorites!).  Was there when it opened on a Saturday and had a Wrestler's Naan Roll with the house chai that just kept on coming.  I had some writing work I was doing and despite the fact that the restaurant continued to fill up I was never rushed or hurried or made to feel like I could stay forever (I've experienced that same hospitality at the Kings Cross location).  If you're even thinking about coming here for breakfast, or any meal, cease your thinking and get to booking."
25/9/2018,4 star rating,"One does not go to London without going to the legendary Dishoom. It's the only place on Yelp that has 1300+ reviews and 4.5 stars. I had high expectations and was nervous that this place would be severely overhyped, but Dishoom was an A+ in my book. I heard the wait times can be insanely long (one night we called and they said it was 2 hour queue for dinner). So we decided to go the next day for lunch and prayed to the food Gods. We got there at 12pm on the dot and our prayer was answered as we got seated immediately. The place was already packed on both levels. Decor is cute and what I love about this place is that for every meal purchased, they donate a meal to an organization charity :) More reasons to eat here! We ended up with the chicken tikka masala (called chicken ruby on the menu), the paneer masala, black house daal, garlic naan, and the keam. Everything was beyond fantastic. As everyone suggests, I highly recommend the chicken ruby and  daal (vegetarian and slow cooked for 24 hours). Consistency was nice, creamy, and not overly thick. Tender chunks of meat that just pair so well with the naan. Thankfully for me, the food was not terribly spicy which made my eating experience more enjoyable. Service was prompt, courteous, and on point. Water was always refilled without asking, and the flow of the place didn't make me feel rushed despite the growing lines outside. Overall, I would recommend coming here to cross it off the bucket list. Wasn't expecting such amazing Indian food in London and am pleasantly surprised, but no complaints here :D Note: the dishes do not come with rice. You need to order it separately and it costs around $3USD per bowl. Note 1: there also seems to be sister locations of Dishoom nearby? Haven't been there but would imagine it to be similar, so if this place is packed maybe stop by it's other location."
7/10/2019,4 star rating,"After doing extensive research on the best Indian food in London, we went with Dishoom because of its high praises both on Yelp and on Google in general. We arrived shortly after 5.30pm, hoping to skip the dinner rush, but there was a line outside already. We only waited about 20 minutes, but when we left around 7pm there was a looooong line so my advice is to arrive early. We decided to try two appetizers - chilli chicken (crispy fried chicken) and pau bhaji (mashed vegetables in a curry-like sauce). Both were absolutely delicious. For mains, we got the chicken ruby (often called butter chicken), roti and garlic naan bread, murgh malai (marinated chicken thigh meat) and of course some jasmin rice on the side. Again, our food was delicious. We were pretty hungry and ended up ordering another plate of chicken ruby. If you're looking for delicious flavored Indian food, Dishoom definitely delivers. My only complaint would be the £££ for sides such as naan and roti. £ 3.50 is pretty pricey for the small portions of naan that you get. It is only a piece each essentially and I saw people at other tables order it over and over again because they ran out so fast. Overall, a great visit and I would go again. I'm very curious about their brunch/breakfast menu so next time we're in London we'll be back for that."
14/9/2021,5 star rating,Just go.  You won't be disappointed!  The chai tea is to die for and all their dishes are amazing.  We got an assortment of dishes and each one was spot on!
20/9/2018,5 star rating,"Came for breakfast after a quick flight in from Zurich -- excellent food, and an interesting middle ground between boring/traditional English breakfast food and Dishoom style.  I had the bacon naan sandwich (which was excellent) and fried eggs on chili cheese toast (also great), plus a breakfast lassi and espresso.  Probably the best breakfast I've had in Europe.  Unsurprisingly the restaurant is still packed even at 9am in a weekday."
18/12/2019,5 star rating,"Had dinner here. Had breakfast here. Both times were excellent. Dinner: It was just two of us. We over ordered simply because we didn't know when we'd be able to eat here again since our stay in London was quite brief and we wanted to try things. We started with okra fries, which were such a great shareable starter. It wasn't terribly heavy as a fried dish. It was crunchy. And unlike how I'm use to okra's membrane, it was not at all mucilaginous. Thin strips, seasoned, fried. It disappeared fast. As I said, we went overboard. We ordered the House Black Daal, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Chicken Berry Britannia*, Mattar Paneer, Mutton Pepper Fry (half-plate) and Plain Naan. Between the two of us, we finished it all. And oh boy, did I regret it. I was so full. Definitely over ate BECAUSE IT WAS SO GOOD! But if I were to personally choose a sufficient order for two, I would say that I would have simply stuck with maybe three dishes. For me, it would have to be Okra fries, Chicken Berry Britannia (which was my favorite), and either the black daal or Mattar Paneer. I'd probably throw in naan just because it seems...right. Again, honestly, you can't really go wrong. From what it seemed like based on our over ordered tasting, you can't really go wrong. If you're unfamiliar with the cuisine, I would try whatever you think is of interest and then confer with your server. Always nice to converse with the people who are around the food. A delightful thing to know is that with every meal purchased, a meal is provided for a child in India. The restaurant sells cookbooks detailing the recipes for every dish on the menu plus history and PICTURES! Breakfast: So apparently, Dishoom serves one of the best breakfasts in London. If you're looking for an alternative to a full English or a café sandwich, try a naan roll. I ordered the Wrestler's Naan Roll and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. Oh man! The naan holds sausage, bacon, and eggs together and when the menu says that the eggs are runny, it is runny. It was a right sized meal for me to get me going. It could be too much for others. It came with a side of, what I believe to be, chutney(?). It was like a sweet jam made of fruit I couldn't identify. Nevertheless, it was altogether delicious. I'd have it again. All in all, I'd eat here again. Ambience is great. You have somewhat of a view of the working kitchen - at least a clear view of one of the staff preparing naan. Go for it! Try to either go at odd eating times or make reservations. It's a popular spot. They'll try seat you as soon as possible but be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes during busier times. Delicious!!!!!!"
3/9/2019,5 star rating,"I had always thought I did not like Indian food until I dined here. Indian food was either too overwhelming, too spicy or too sweet for my taste especially after visiting Mumbai many years ago. Mumbai's food evidently was not as life changing for me as the food at this Indian restaurant located in the middle of Covent Garden. Dishoom is a great experience if you are looking for fabulously interesting and ethnic food experience in London. You can't get reservations. You just have to show up and wait in line for over an hour to get a table. But trust me, it's worth it. We have only tried a few dishes here. However, an absolute must would be Chicken Ruby even if you don't like chicken. It's all about the exquisite sauce! For dessert, definitely try the Pistachio Kulfi on a stick. It's like ice cream on a stick except better! Pick Dishoom for your dining experience even if you are in London for just a day."
22/1/2017,4 star rating,"When in London, you got to have some Indian! If you don't have a reservation, the waiting queue is out the door. I didn't have a reservation and was told the wait time was 1 hour and half in which my boyfriend and I waited as we had nothing better to do that day. While on line, they would serve you some hot chai milk tea to wait as we were there during the winter. The line actually moves pretty quick and in less than an hour, it was our turn. Once we enter the restaurant, there is another short wait down by the open bar but the wait there was also pretty short and we were then taken to our table. The curries were amazing! Although, I kind of wish I didn't order the mango dessert as it was just a Popsicle stick. I thought it would be something authentic that I can't get anywhere else, but it was still good nonetheless."
31/7/2018,5 star rating,"Food: 5 | Service: 5 | Ambiance: 4 I don't think I can write much that other reviewers haven't said already. I just want to say the food was amazing. Ordering the fried okra is a must! I ordered the garlic naan and the chicken ruby as well. Since I dipped the naan in the chicken ruby I think I could've gotten the plain naan, but it was probably even more amazing with the garlic. Service was fantastic too. It was fast and accurate which is really all you can ask for. The server was charming as well. Highly recommend this place!"
3/10/2019,5 star rating,"Great food, atmosphere, and service! Best experience I've ever had waiting for a table at a busy restaurant. There seems to always be a long wait of at least an hour at any Dishoom, but the staff really make that feel painless. They kept the line outside moving pretty quickly, and even offered little sample cups of hot chai or sherry, and umbrellas! It was a cold and slightly rainy evening, so those offerings were not only surprising but really nice! The chai was really nice by the way- very spicy and flavorful. They kept the line moving and had people head inside for a bit more of a wait, but they give you a buzzer to hang onto and head down to the bar area and they give you the free WiFi code. We ordered Chicken Ruby, Pau Bhaji, House Black Daal, Roomali Roti, steamed basmati rice, and mango and fennel lassis. The mango lassi comes with fennel seeds sprinkled on top, but you can order with no fennel seeds. They brought us garlic naan instead of the roomali roti, but they quickly brought the correct bread when we told them about the mistake, and they didn't charge us for the naan. However, I actually wasn't a fan of the roti- it's more like a tortilla and isn't good for scooping up the food. And if you order the house black daal, I recommend having naan with it because it's a lentil dish that has the consistency of a thick soup, best to be eaten almost like a dip with the naan. The daal was very good. It cooks for 24 hours- so it's very deep in flavor and rich, but surprisingly mild at the same time. A nice dish. The chicken ruby was similar to a butter chicken we've had at Indian restaurants, also a great dish. And the pau bhaji was really nice- a tasty veggie and spice mash served with baked buns. The dipping sauces they serve with dinner are all really nice too. Great ambiance as well- low lighting, warm, and inviting with amazing aroma throughout the restaurant. Definitely a must try!"
21/5/2018,4 star rating,"Indian food? Heck yeah! Indian breakfast foods? Sign me the F@%k up!! To be honest, I did not really know what Indian breakfast food was before visiting Dishoom. The Indian restaurants in Florida mainly serve lunch and dinner only, so an Indian restaurant open for breakfast definitely piqued my interest. There's multiple Dishoom locations throughout the city. For breakfast, we made a reservation online at their Covent Garden location. When we arrived around 8:30AM, it was pretty empty! I don't think the reservation was even necessary at that point. But around 9:30 -10:00 AM, when we were leaving tables were filling up quickly. For appetizer, we ordered the bacon & egg naan roll. Hot & fresh baked naan with chili tomato and fresh herb sauce. I ordered the Kejriwal as my main meal, which is two fried eggs on chili cheese toast. The fiance ordered The Big Bombay, the sausage and baked beans English-style breakfast with an Indian twist. Every plate was bursting with bright colors and looked absolutely delectable. An explosion of flavors in each bite. Go early to avoid the lines. Best and most unique breakfast you'll have in a while! We loved it so much that we visited another location by the train station for late dinner."
5/1/2020,5 star rating,Heavenly.  One of the best recommendations for indian food in London. Long wait outside but the staff was kind enough to bring warm drinks and the food and service did not disappoint! We went to one in London and another in Scotland. The London location was truly the best.
9/6/2018,5 star rating,"Things to do: 1) Order the House Chai 2) Order the Bacon Naan 3) Repeat We arrived around 11:15, 30 minutes before the end of breakfast and was seated within 5 minutes. The place was packed. Loud, casual ambiance with both table and booth seating. Looking around, you can see the naan being made fresh behind the counter. For drinks we ordered the house chai and mint tea. The chai was the best chai I've ever had. Rich, spicy, and soothing, the (sadly) small glass of chai was an excellent way to start the morning. The mint tea could be smelled from a mile away, that's how fresh and refreshing the mint was. We ordered the bacon naan, akuri, the big Bombay, and the kejriwal, which was eggs on chili cheese toast. The bacon naan was superb. The tamarind BBQ sauce complemented the bacon extremely well. The Kejriwal was just okay. The bread was kind of tough and the flavors didn't meld too well together. I'd rather have had a second naan. The other people in my group enjoyed the Akuri and The Big Bombay, especially commenting on the taste of mushrooms. If I could give half-stars, this place would get 4.5/5. Not perfect, but pretty darn close."
24/12/2019,5 star rating,"Let me begin with - IT IS WORTH THE WAIT. I don't even really like Indian food. I am extra boring and bland and can't handle too many spices and coming from Hawaii, I swear we just don't have any good Indian food. That being said, Dishoom was the best food I had in London. Period. Waiting in line, we were told it was about an 80 minute wait. I had heard so many great things that I said I didn't care and forced my foodie partner in crime to stay there, despite all of his complaining. That 80 minute wait really deterred some of the people in front of us and we ended up only waiting about 40 minutes. During this time, they also handed out drinks to keep us warm and I had some yummy chai. Once we got inside, I wanted to order everything. I didn't know where to start or what anything was. Sooooo I went with the infamous black daal and all the naan I could eat. And, it blew my mind. It's lucky I don't live in London (yet) or I'd be there every chance I could get. Service was superb and quick and I can't wait to go back."
18/2/2019,5 star rating,"Love the interior decoration! It was fun. I remembered there's a sign at the door saying something like ""sorry cash only"" or ""no credit card "". I didn't plan to step in until they told me it was a joke. Went here for brunch. Chai was great! Actually I don't quite remember what I got cuz it's been a while... but anyway I was traveling from the states and from where I'm from there's nothing like this. Definitely a new experience!"
1/12/2018,5 star rating,"How do you come to London without going to Dishoom? We've never eaten out at an Indian restaurant and were excited that this would be our first time dining out experience. We love some good Indian and Dishoom lived up to our expectations. The line/queue was quite long. (We waited 50 minutes or so). Everything was delicious and full of flavor. This place knows what they are doing. Everything from the lamb samosas to the lamb kababs, the garlic naan, the bowl of greens, the gunpowder potatoes, the ruby chicken were amazing. Skip the chicken masala (you can get this anywhere) and go for the Ruby Chicken. I promise you won't regret it."
9/9/2018,5 star rating,"Best meal of curry I have ever had! Making online reservations is pretty easy. I made the reservation in advance based on my friend's recommendation and you should too! There's always a line at the door during meal time. Since it was our first time here, we asked our server what she recommends but we ended up ordering too much food. What we were told was 3 dishes per person and everything is meant to shared. We order 5 dishes for the two of us so we ended with a bunch of food left and it's sad that we couldn't take away. My favorite: Chicken Ruby !!! (Chicken curry with a tomato based sauce) Smashed vegetables with buns (forgot its name) Black Daal (lentil with a creamy curry based sauce)"
29/10/2018,5 star rating,"Service-wise, the best we got compared to anywhere else in London. My friend found this spot and we decided to try it. We went around 5 or 6 PM and there was already a line forming. I was just so amazed at how organized this waiting process was. While you're waiting in line, they bring out samples of chai tea for you to enjoy! We waited around an hour outside. When we got to the front of the line outside, they take you inside downstairs with a buzzer to their bar to wait some more. When we got downstairs somebody greeted us right away ""Christine?"" and took us to our spot at the bar. There is free wifi while you wait too. Wow! Then a very friendly server came to ask if we wanted any drinks. We were seated at our table not too long after. -Pau Bhaji: Must get!!!! This was my favorite dish here. Ordered it not really knowing what it was but got it because everyone else raved about it, and it's amazing! Especially with the hot bun it comes with....ahh -Garlic naan: really good as well. Especially with the chicken ruby sauce/pau bhaji -Chicken Berry Biryani: good, but too spicy for me. I didn't know it was a spicy dish, I had my friend eat most of this. -Mango lassi: omg!!! SOooooo goooood and creamy. I loved the little fennel seeds it comes with - added a nice touch to it. We were both pretty damn hungry coming into Dishoom but we couldn't finish everything. The portions don't look that big but it was all very filling. So glad I got to try this place in London! Probably the best real meal we had in London."
1/7/2018,5 star rating,"Seriously DELICIOUS!! I rarely enjoy Indian food, and when I do it is rare that I enjoy the entire Trinity- food, drinks, ambience.  Dishoom has nailed all three!!!"
20/8/2016,5 star rating,"""You HAVE to eat Indian food while you're in London!"" is what I heard over and over again before our trip.  We only spent two days in London, but Dishoom was definitely my favorite meal while we were there. We got in line around 10pm on a Saturday night and were told the wait would be over an hour.  Several people in line decided to jump ship upon hearing this....DON'T BE THOSE PEOPLE!  We waited for maybe 20 minutes before we were seated.  I asked my friend who lives in London about this and she's had the same experience multiple times as well.  Even if the wait were an hour, the food is worth it. - Dishoom IPA: Yes, they have their own beer and it's good! - Okra Fries: Highly recommend this as an app.  If you think you don't like okra, think again.  This is not that slimy fried okra we have in the states!  The fries are crispy and really well seasoned. - Black House Daal: A signature dish for a good reason.  The flavors are incredible and we ended up ordering a second serving of garlic naan just to finish this off. - Chicken Ruby: Husband ordered this because it was mentioned in almost every single review and he loved it.  I had a couple of bites as well and ended up convincing him that should just share our dishes. HA! - Mahi Tikka: This was my order and it was SO good.  The fish is cooked perfectly, leaving it juicy, flaky, and tender. Our server was friendly and the food came out super fast.  My husband, who is normally not a huge fan of Indian food, could not stop raving about this place and has recommended it to several of his friends who were visiting London.  Now that says a lot!"
31/7/2019,5 star rating,Iv heard Indian food is a must in London so I immediately knew we picked the right spot when there was a line outside the place and the wait was an hour and 10 min ! The inside is super cute and everything we ordered was AMAZING. Best samosa Iv ever had!! We also had ruby chicken that was to die for. The chai was amazing but they also had some juice with passion fruit!! Amazing!
5/3/2021,5 star rating,"They decided to celebrate my birthday in this wonderful restaurant. The manager helped with the organization of the event, the decoration of the hall, and the preparation of the menu. They agreed on prices, they are quite adequate here. The dishes are delicious! The holiday was a success !!"
3/11/2018,3 star rating,"American here. Multiple people recommended Dishoom to my husband and me when they heard we'd be in London for vacation. We waited in line for nearly an hour, but we were prepare to wait. The waitstaff was very nice. They offered us water and some sort of Indian lemon drink while we waited. Once we entered the restaurant, we knew that this was not the place to have an intimate meal. The place was packed! Our waiter was kind, but also very busy. The food was okay. The biryani and potato dish we ordered were the highlights. I wanted to enjoy my meal, but it was just too busy and hurried, so I felt rushed. I'd come again and I think I'd have a better time because I'd know what to expect."
24/3/2018,3 star rating,"Considering this was 4.5stars with over 1100 reviews, I was expecting a lot from this restaurant.  Even though this was 2 $$, it was still relatively expensive.   Food/drinks ordered: - Sweet & mango lassi: Dishoom did their own twist to the traditional lassi.  It's a bit more watered down and they added ice to the mixture as well.  The spices they added to the lassi are an acquired taste.  The mango lassi was actually more tangy than sweet.   - Okra fries: This is actually pretty good.  Crispy and quite flavorful.  I liked - The black daal is their specialty, so I got this.  It was flavorful and tasty.  I wouldn't say it blew me away, but it was still good. - Chicken ruby: tender and tasty.  Again, this is just average. - The prawn mooli was really nice.  It was light and the prawns weren't overcooked. Overall, I didn't think there was anything special about the restaurant.  If I wanted exceptional Indian food for lunch, I'd go to Tamarind @ MayFair for lunch."
2/8/2019,4 star rating,"It's been almost 3 months since my trip to London and I am still dreaming about their chai. We ordered the Murg Malai, lamb chops, and chicken ruby curry. ALL delicious however it is a tad bit pricey for small portions. But I guess that's London for you. My waitress was very kind and helpful on deciding what to order. Overall services seems pretty good. I'd definitely go again when I visit London again!!"
1/12/2019,3 star rating,High quality no doubt but the plates and drinks were incredibly small for the lavash amount paid. In terms of quality I highly reccomend in regards to your wallet I'd venture elsewhere as there is better Indian food in London and food that is much less stealing from your purse. Atmoshphere was nice and service was good. Will only be back if I'm dragged along.
10/10/2019,4 star rating,One cant visit the Dishoom without no forms of memories thinking of how to get back again..I must say is something great and pleasant on all sides when i visited London early January 2019. It was yummy yummy and the workers were also putting all efforts ..I could say i enjoyed a lot of their appetizers for starter and main dish too...
7/7/2019,4 star rating,"We came here during our trip in London with reservations because we heard that lining up outside would take awhile. Surely, we were glad to have made reservations because it was rainy and windy that day to wait hours in line to eat. Our server was super kind and chill. He took his time to explaining items to us and recommending if things were too much or too little. When he didn't know an answer to our question, he got the answer immediately from another colleague. Super great service, cute spot, and decor. The menu was also on a newspaper-like texture and design, which was very unique to ya. I appreciated being seated in a booth, but having shared that it was my friend's birthday, we didn't receive anything special nor did anyone say ""Happy Birthday"" to them :( food was solid, and would definitely recommend trying it here: * Okra fries (4.7£) - delicious and healthy! Masala prawns - grilled and flavorful. A touch of lime squeezed on top made it even tastier. Recommend ordering. * Chefs covent garden special (12.9£) - we ordered half of this and was disappointed because we didn't pay attention to that fact that it was lamb :( we both weren't a fan of lamb but tried it and couldn't continue. Though i do believe, lamb lovers would have loved it. * House black Daal (6.50£) - surprisingly delicious! I don't think I've ever had beans like this before and it was so flavorful and rich that i smothered it all over my naan. Recommend! * Garlic naan (3.5£) - i have honestly loved naan anywhere I've gone but it's so tasty because it's freshly warmed! Must get for anything you eat here so you can dip it in all the things! * Chicken ruby (10.9£) - similar to tikka masala so i wasn't disappointed at all. I loved it and would eat this forever and ever if i could :) * Dishoom chocolate pudding (6.9£): chocolate pudding with a light chili flavored ice cream. Surprisingly not bad but i wouldn't order over and over again. Worth a try if it peaks your interests. * Mango & fennel lassi (4.2£) - yummy! Love mango lassi but could have done it without the fennel on top. * Passion fruit sharbat (3.9£) - also yummy and refreshing with the heavy meal. * Viceroy's Old fashion (9.9£) - my friend ordered this and we were both in love with the delivery. It was in a cute potion-like bottle that allows you to pour into your own glass. Overall, it wasn't super expensive, but about 93£ total. I'd say it's worth trying when visiting London. Awesome service and experience."
3/9/2018,5 star rating,This was my favorite Indian cuisine experience in London. The modern chic decor with touches of tradition came together well in the basement bar. We sampled several vegetarian small plates. Get the black lentils! They were cooked perfectly and well seasoned. I will keep Dishoom on my list when I return to London.
20/9/2018,4 star rating,"Yum yum yum! Tasty and unique (maybe unique, maybe authentic and I'm just ignorant) Indian cuisine! It's not your typical menu and actually pretty limited with the main entrees if you have something particular in mind. I got the chicken ruby curry and it was suuuuuper tasty. A bit of spice but nothing unbearable. Pair it over rice and you have a hearty, homey, meal. The lamb chops were tender and flavorful. The mango lassi was AMAZING. The garlic naan was fluffy and perfect for dipping. The fried okra was good enough. I don't think I'd wait over an hour for this. Come during lunch, the line is much better and it's the same experience!"
28/5/2018,5 star rating,"This straight reminded me of some of the best indian food i tasted back in India. We went on a Sunday night and were in line for around 30 mins before they invited us in the bar area, followed by a proper table in the dining area in around 20 mins (total 50 mins)! We did not mind the wait. At the bar, we ordered Kala Khatta (non alcoholic drink,  mixed with  flavorful  spices, traditional to indian palette) and dishoom india pale. Both were great and we could not wait for the main course! For main course, we ordered lamb samosas, pau bhaji, chicken ruby, garlic naan and roomali roti. Lamb samosas were 5/5 and Pau Bhaji may be a 4/5 (i have had better). They served samosas with three different chutneys, which was amazing! Chicken ruby was tender, juicy, rich in flavors, and lip smacking good! I literally could have wiped the plate clean! So good. We ended the dinner with house tea, which was AMAZING!! Can't wait to come back."
2/10/2019,5 star rating,"I hate to admit it, but I don't think my taste buds really care for Indian cuisine.  However, on my most recent trip to London, I couldn't ignore the fact that this place received raving reviews about their food.   My boyfriend and I came here for a late breakfast before we headed out to explore the city.  We both had the bacon naan roll and it was one of the most delicious things I've eaten!  I was really surprised by how yummy everything was, from the pillowy softness of the bread, to the savoury flavour of the bacon that was complimented nicely with some sweetness from the tomato jam. I'm not sure when we will be back in London (hopefully soon, after we visit some other destinations on our list), but I would definitely come back here again!!"
1/1/2019,5 star rating,Bacon & Egg Naan Roll: 5/5 Ruby Chicken: 4/5 Okra Fries: 5/5 Garlic Naan: 5/5
10/5/2016,5 star rating,"First meal in England and it was a great decision. Food: We ordered the Mahi Tikka, Spicy Lamb Chop, and Chicken Ruby. Our sides were roomalti roti and some buttered naan. All 3 dishes were amazing. The lamb was cooked perfectly. The Mahi was flaky and juicy. The chicken ruby was creamy and hearty. All three dishes combined with the sides worked perfectly well. Drinks: 1) Chai: One word. Bottomless. You can't go wrong with that. Even if it weren't unlimited, I would get a few. 2) Americano: Decent. Not the best but above average. Service: Our waiter was great. He took the time to explain to us everything on the menu. He also kept convincing me to get more chai, which I'm not sure if that was a good or bad thing... It's good in my book! I would definitely recommend coming back here!"
20/1/2018,5 star rating,"We booked Dishoom for our office Christmas Party dinner because our events coordinator is totally bomb. That also means we didn't have to wait for 2 hours outside!! HAZAHHHHH!!! This is now my third visit to Dishoom, and to be quite honest, it has only gotten better and better for me. I'm not even quite sure how to describe this experience because it was so amazing. Well, they have a Christmas dinner option with different price options. We had the £30 option which included 3 starters, and 5 entrees, and an option of 1 dessert. It was family style and there was so much food. Anyway, the point is you should go for Christmas dinner because it's awesome, and if it's not Christmas, you should still go because it's delicious. See below for my fav dishes:   Bhel (crunchy puffed rice tossed with fresh pomegranate, tomato, onion, lime, tamarind, mint)- it's a lovely starter with especially nice textures and very fresh. Samosas- because samosas. Jackfruit Biryani- The jackfruit tastes like chicken- it's even got the texture of chicken and it's very confusing for a vegetarian but also a wonderful experience. Hahahahaha so weird. Anyway, the rice itself has fantastic flavour and a good amount of spice. One of my favourite dishes  fo sho. Sometimes rice makes me nervous because I feel like it'll be too dry, but this rice is so great and perfectly balanced. Mattar Paneer- Creaaaammmy baby! It's just so good. The sauce is the magical thing. It's so rich and delectable. The paneer is a nice touch, but I'd just take the sauce with the peas. Delish. House Black Daal- So, the first time I tried this dish, I wasn't crazy about it. I don't know what it was. But the second time... holy guacamole batman, this shit hit the spot. (apparently I start to sound super American when I get very enthusiastic about something and I'm now starting to notice it as I type). BUT FOR REAL GUYS THIS DISH IS SERIOUSLY LIKE THE BEST. There you go. The flavours are so deep, and it's like the flavour just gets deeper and more delicious as you eat it. Their mango Kulfi on a stick is absolutely amazing. I was so full but I managed to eat mine and two other people's because they were so creamy and delightful! ***random side note*** I was actually very upset towards the end of our meal because there was so much food left over and I didn't want it to go to waste. (We were going to a bar afterwords) I started freaking out a little bit and eating way more than normal, but wasn't hardly making a dent. Then I had the genius idea of just taking it all with us out and back home. So I did. And I brought it to work the next day and fed everyone twice! WINNING!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and of course I also kept extra for myself. I LOVE DISHOOM."
19/2/2018,5 star rating,"BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER. Hands down, no questions asked. Came here with my mom and sister and here's what we ordered: 1. Prawn Koliwada (6.20) 2. Dishoom Chicken Tikka (7.90) 3. Paneer Tikka (7.70) 4. House Black Daal (5.90) 5. Chicken Berry Britannia (9.50) 6. Chicken Ruby (9.50) 7. Garlic Naan (2.90) 8. Steamed Basmati Rice (2.90) Every single dish was outstanding! If I had to choose my top 3 dishes to order they would be the Prawn Koliwada, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and House Black Daal. But honestly, you cannot go wrong with any dish you order! The Prawn Koliwada was so crisp and fresh and the chutney was unlike any I've ever had! I was so obsessed. Both the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and House Black Daal were so flavorful and rich in the best way. The chicken in the Dishoom Chicken Tikka was tender and juicy and cooked so nicely. The service here is fantastic and the ambiance is very fun and trendy. If you have not been here before and you're visiting London, Dishoom is a must! My family and I arrived here around 4pm and waited for about an hour! Apparently the wait is much longer near dinner time so if you're flexible I would definitely come as early as possible! Would love to come back to Dishoom the next time I am in town."
11/10/2019,5 star rating,We were beyond happy with our experience at Dishoom! The food was excellent and plentiful. We did the preplanned menu for a party of 10 and it was a great experience. The staff was also very accommodating and provided excellent service.
11/3/2016,4 star rating,Dishoom.. We need you in California. Since when did Indians make breakfast rolls with the naan? Have I been living in a cave or is this a UK thing?!? Cmon bruv!! A warm flat naan with some amazing smoked bacon coated with a sweet sauce and a perfectly runny egg where the yolk bursts when you take a bite?! And the little bits of mint that compliment the savory sweetness perfectly?! Wow.. I could eat this for breakfast any day of the week. I thought this place was awesome but its just based on one breakfast item. They give you a little red sweet jelly type of sauce to dip it in. Sooooooo goood!! OH MY DAYS! Lol..
7/7/2018,5 star rating,"This was our first ever Indian/Irani food experiance ever and it didn't disappoint! First we started off with drinks since we had a 20 min wait (no biggie on a saturday at 9). I got the cobada colada (I think, it's a tongue twister!) It was absolutely delish and tasted like a vacation in a glass. Once seated, our waitress was incredibly kind and recommended a bunch of stuff. We went with the black daal, chicken ruby, gunpowder potatoes, rice, and garlic naan. All were so flavorful and tasty. Our favorite dish was the chicken ruby. All dishes are meant to be shared. Everything is also very reasonably priced in my opinion (nothing we got was over 10.)   For a restaurant with over 1200 Yelp reviews, I see why! A unique and exciting food experiance."
20/10/2019,5 star rating,"Even though we had to w for 1 hour it still gets a 5. The service, food, drinks and atmosphere were all first rate. They handle the tables rely well so the wait time is accurate. No reservations so pick your time carefully otherwise prepare to Q."
28/7/2016,5 star rating,"When we were planning our trip to London, I knew Indian food had to be something we ate while we were there. I looked at many places until I found Dishoom. The reviews looked promising so we chose the Covent Garden location based on preference of where we wanted to be. When we arrived we saw a long line. It was almost like the lines you see to get into a bar/nightclub. I had been warned about the lines from other reviews but was surprised by what we saw. We were immediately greeted by a staff member who took our names down and apologized for the wait. He said it was going to be an hour and half. Yes an hour and a half. But we were determined and everyone else in line seemed to be in good spirits so we got comfortable and waited. They do take reservations for parties of 6 or more. The staff offered us some chai tea and green tea to sip on while we waited. The line moved and when we made it to the front, we were greeted with another staff member who led us to the bar. From there we ordered drinks and then a staff member came and took our drinks to our table. We were taken care of by 4 people even before we sat down. The restaurant's vibe is Our server came and made recommendations. By that point, we had already decided on what we wanted because we had plenty of time to look at it. We ordered Chicken Tikka, Chicken Biryani, rice, regular naan and garlic naan, and raita (yogurt sauce). The food was so delicious. The food comes out family style which is typical in Indian culture. Everything was well made, flavorful, and a good amount of spice. The service was fantastic too. Like I said, from the moment we got in line until we left, we were well taken care off. Definitely worth it."
25/5/2016,4 star rating,"We were told Dishoom was the best Indian food in London, and Indian food is pretty rampant in these parts.  It was pretty tasty (after a few days of eating sub par food, since during the holidays most things are closed).  While most of the dishes had good flavor, there were some misses.   Grab a few dishes of curry, naan, tikka. The biryani is a good staple.  Some of the food has good heat to it, so don't forget to pair it with some raita to cool it down. All in all, this is a great place for groups.  A good time and pretty good curry."
19/12/2019,4 star rating,I was recommended Dishoom by a fellow volunteer for my layover in London on my way back home from Greece. The design inside is both elegant and traditional. The atmosphere is both warm and welcoming. The food is flavorful and right to texture and proportion. I did order more than I could eat though since I was only party of one but wanted to try a couple of things. I'd definitely come back one day if I'm in London.
12/8/2019,5 star rating,"I never thought I'd say an hour and a half wait would be worth any meal - but it is at Dishoom! Now this wait was partially my bad, no they don't take reservations past 5:45pm for small parties, but my partner and I showed up at 6:30 on a Saturday night - aka peak time. The staff was so friendly during this wait, they even pass out hot chai tea! (and you can grab some beers from a convenience store around the corner while you wait as long as one person stays in line) Now for the food: my partner and I split the lamb samosas, a lamb chop, the house black daal, the fish tikka, chicken curry, and garlic naan. Our socks were blown off by each dish after the next. The fish was a favorite of mine (and a recommendation from a loyal regular we met in line) it was melt in the mouth soft, like butter, and the seasonings were just impeccable (on everything)! The lamb chops were tender, the samosas were perfectly crispy and flavorful, the black daal was something not to miss, and the curry was lick the bowl delicious. We finished our meal with the chocolate pudding and chili ice cream dessert, and it was the perfect juxtaposition of hot and cold, spicy and sweet, rich and light. Everything consumed at Dishoom was the best I've ever eaten - no lie, no exaggeration. If you like Indian food, or even if you don't, get your butt down here! (but be prepared for a wait)"
1/12/2017,3 star rating,"My husband and I had lunch at this location the other day.  We arrived just before noon.  We did not have a reservation, but the hostess said that was no problem.  She would seat us at the end of a long table for 10 people, but said she would need it back by 1:30.  This was not an issue for us, but it did seem a bit odd.  I've only been to a few places that have told me I can have a table for a limited amount of time, but most of the time it is because the restaurant is so amazing that they are overbooked, so although in one sense it bothered me, in another sense I was now even more excited to eat here because, dang this place must be good.   For drinks my husband ordered a watermelon cooler which he described as a watermelon mojito, no alcohol.  I was debating between a chai and a lassi.  I love both, but I have a tendency to fill up on lassis before my food arrives.  However, there was a guy at another table with this gorgeous pink drink.  When I asked the server what it was and he said the rose and cardamom lassi, I knew I had to have it.  To be honest, it was my favorite thing I consumed at this meal.  It was heavenly.  It had just the right amount of sweetness and the a gorgeous flavor of roses, but it did sort of fill me up.   For entree my husband ordered the lamb chops.  He saw a thousand things he wanted to order on the menu and was having a terrible time deciding, but once I started showing him pictures on Yelp he knew that is what he wanted and he said they were incredible.  I'm not super into red meat right now.  My pregnancy has largely turned me off to most red meat,  but they did look gorgeous.  I ordered the chicken ruby.  Here's my issue, it was one of only 2 curries on the menu.  I mean it is kind of cool to go to an Indian restaurant that has different stuff and when we were in India most restaurants had curries, and tandoori, and biriyani, but I really felt like 2 curries was a super limited selection.  There was no korma, xacuti, vindaloo, madras, etc.  For my personal taste this lack of selection of sauces was a bummer.   The chicken ruby was very good, but far from the best I've ever had.  It tasted like butter chicken to me.  The spicy flavor didn't kick in until the very last minute.  I ordered it with basmati rice which was fine, but in no way special, and roti, which again was fine, but not special.   With his lamb my husband ordered the black daal which everyone raved about and we found to be lackluster.  These were far from the best lentils we've ever had.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was a bit odd too.  We sat upstairs and I am glad we did.  When I went downstairs it was like a whole different restaurant.  It was loud, crowded and cramped.  The upstairs was a bit like that, but not to that extent.   Finally, the prices were a bit steep as well.  After, Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, this was the second most expensive meal we ate in London, so it is pretty pricey.  We definitely enjoyed it, but I don't think we enjoyed it that much and for all those who say this place is worth the wait, I am going to have to politely disagree.  Again, it is good, but it is not outstanding.  Perhaps I am spoiled by my vast selection of Indian at home or by the fact that I have traveled and spent time in India.  I had really high expectations for Indian food in London and this didn't really meet them."
27/7/2018,5 star rating,"It seems like dishoom grew in popularity since I last visited in 2014 and I'm not surprised! My friends and family have heard me rave about it for years and I still stand by the fabulous menu! My husband and I visited the covent garden location on a Friday evening back in April - literally during peak dinner hours. I knew we would have about a 2 hour wait so we made sure to have a snack beforehand. Loved that the host outside was handing out piping hot glasses of chai, it helped make the wait in the rain a little better. We were finally seated in the downstairs dining area and it was bustling with people, just as I remember it on Friday evenings. When I was in grad school, dishoom was my weekly indulgence of Indian street food and I had the menu memorized forward and backwards. I liked seeing that most of my favorites were still on the menu - black dal, gunpowder potatoes, paneer tikka and murgh malai. We tried a new dish this time, which I really enjoyed as well, the goan shrimp curry. Everything tasted fresh and so delicious! I still feel like this is some of the best Indian food you can find in London!"
5/9/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing! I've heard about fishhook through friends and bloggers on Instagram. My cousins and I came for dinner one night and brunch 2 days later. While I preferred the dinner, both were good. The drinks were delicious. We ordered a variety of things and the most notable and delicious once's were the spicy chili toast, the dhal (which I normally don't love but it was so good!), the okra frys, the chicken ruby and lamb chops. The chops were so juicy and tender. For breakfast, we really enjoyed the chicken egg burji and the chai, which is endless. There are no reservations for dinner, there's a wait outside at a first come first serve basis. While you wait in line, someone does offer your water and lemonade which I thought was really nice. We came on a Wednesday night as a group of 5 and waited about a hour and half. You can make reservations for breakfast which was really easy to make."
15/9/2019,5 star rating,"This place was the best restaurant I went to during my visit to London! I loved the ambiance, the variety of food, the proportions and the price. I had the paneer tikka roll which was amazing and perfectly cooked. My brother had the Ruby chicken and loooved it. Said it was one of the best chicken dishes he's had. I recommend going if you love Indian or want to try Indian food. The hype is real."
13/6/2018,4 star rating,"Waited 1.5hr on a Sunday night to get seated with 3 friends.  They came out with comp shots of lemonades and dates and grapes which was nice. We ordered fried okras, the far far (like prawn crackers texture) and Dishoom calamari (breaded fried calamari) for appetizers.  The fried okras were so good we ordered a 2nd one! My friends ordered the chicken ruby, chicken berry Britannia with biryani rice and prawn curry.  I had the Murgh Malai (marinated grilled chicken thigh meat). All dishes were flavorful.  The flavor of the biryani rice dish with the sweet berries tasted very good.  The Murgh Malai pieces were tender wth wonderful flavor. Would I come back to eat?  Yes - if I don't have to wait for 1.5hr.  That really took it out of us standing there (luckily it was a nice balmy night)."
10/7/2018,5 star rating,"Wife found this place on Yelp which has over a thousand reviews and 4.5 stars. After several Tube rides we got here and was told the wait would be an hour. However we waited only about 40 minutes and was seated. While in line we chatted with a family from Seattle who had been there and loved it, and highly recommend the fried okra appetizer. They were right about the restaurant being worth the wait and about the okra! We ordered Chicken Ruby which was like chicken Tikka masala, and it was super delicious. We also ordered another curry and it was good, but not as good as the orange curry. We also ordered lamb and chicken tandoori and both were flavorful and tender without being dry. The plain and garlic naan were great to dip the curry. Overall a delicious experience, definitely recommended and definitely will return next time we are in London!"
19/7/2021,5 star rating,Amazing food and amazing service. I've been multiple times with family and friends.
24/3/2018,5 star rating,"So, in advance of going to London, I was told to go to Dishoom as it was the best Indian restaurant. Since I was hearing this from another Indian person who is family, I felt I had to go if it was possible. Considering this location is right near Trafalgar Square, it was quite perfect to stop by in our travels. I was told in advance that the restaurant doesn't take reservations. Apparently it does. We arrived and were told there was a 40-minute wait. So, we put our name on the list, said screw it, and just walked around the general area. When we returned 30 minutes later, our name had already been called and they moved on. It was an annoying start. So we had to wait another 40 minutes that was actually 30 on their patio before being entered into Dishoom. We waited for a little while longer in their bar area before being seated. The vibe in Dishoom is pretty cool. It's packed and we were seated with other guests at long family-style tables. Okay, let me get to the point: the food is some of the best Indian food I've ever had at a restaurant. The house black daal is unbelievable. They claim it is ""cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony"" and you can taste the preparation. The harmony is delightful. For that alone, and at 6 pounds, it is worth going. The other items I got were the okra fries and the paneer tikka, both were delightful as well and I'm sure the meat options are good too for those interested. You could easily break your wallet if your eyes get too big for your stomach as everything looks and is delicious. However, for 2 people, we simply ordered these 3 items and garlic naan and it sufficed in the late afternoon after a long day of walking. To me, it was certainly manageable pricing for quite good food and ambiance in London. I still will rate Dishoom 5 stars but there were two downfalls. I would say the reservation and seating situation was just a little unclear and odd given the popularity of the restaurant. I also think the service was a bit odd at times. I mean it's odd for me as an Indian person to have a white guy tell me about Indian dishes, but hey, that's just me and I know that's his job. But, more so, our server just kind of disappeared at one point without telling us and another server seemed to have no choice but to start serving us and handle our bill when she realized that guy was just gone. But, the reservations/service situation aside, Dishoom was that good that it didn't matter. You should definitely check it out if in London and especially because I'd expect as a tourist you'd be visiting this busy area of the city at some point anyway."
8/7/2019,5 star rating,"Go ahead, call me boring. When I was in London in January, I ate here three times. Note, I was in London for three days. Well, I'm back in the UK and my first meal, Dishoom. I didn't even try to order something new. I went with what I got last time. okra fries, garlic naan, and the infamous Black Dahl. Omg, I nearly forgot the homemade chai drink. It's as close to True Indian saffron tea as I can find. There is always a line outside. They do not have reservations. I don't care if it's a two-hour wait, its worth every minute of standing. I'm convinced that Dishoom is my favorite restaurant of all time."
5/6/2019,2 star rating,"This place was a disappointment. More specifically, if I had paid half of what I'd paid, it would have been acceptable. But I have had much better Indian food, with bigger portion sizes, for less. My sister and I came here right before 5pm and waited for around 45 minutes to be seated. We ordered the Pav Bhaji, mango lassi, dosa, Ruby paneer, and Ruby chicken. The Pav Bhaji was okay but not super flavorful. The bread didn't taste very fresh either. The mango lassi was good and not too sweet. The Ruby paneer was flavorless - I was surprised at how little spice they used. The Ruby chicken curry was good but ridiculously overpriced - the sauce was tomato-y and lightly spiced, but the chicken didn't seem to be marinated. And the dosa was not flaky at all. Even the rice was a disappointment. Slightly mushy and not at all what I would expect. Side note - the decor and atmosphere in the restaurant was good, but the thick incense smell was very irritating for my asthma. A lot of people have asthma, so it might be a good idea to not burn so much incense inside. It also made me wonder if they were trying to cover up something. Why not let the smell of the food shine through? I'd like to emphasize that I've had way better Indian food in small towns. I would expect much more from a big city like London and from the hype that this place gets."
21/12/2019,4 star rating,"A no flair very casual however very nice experience. Loved this place, great vibe great service great atmosphere and the food that goes along. First off I was happy that all the staff speaks English.  Being from Southern California and experiencing disappointments with the lack of quality and lack of the English language in almost all  Indian restaurants these guys need to move to California. I had the basic Chicken Tikal masala, a vegetarian dish which consisted of broccoli ( well prepared ) some bread , raita,  salad , beer , desert , tea . Good food, attentive service, clean what more. Great job guys"
15/7/2021,4 star rating,The food is extremely tasty. the ambience is not that great though. the service is good!
13/6/2019,5 star rating,"Who knew London was known for Indian food? Not me. Indian food has been on my to-do list for quite some time and this definitely checked it off the list. I loved it! Upon reading many reviews I had a strong idea that we would be waiting in the queue for quite some time. We arrived as early as we could and joined queue 1-which gets you the ability to join the real queue 2. Once you get through that line you finally get to enter and wait a little longer with a buzzer at the bar. So all in all the wait was LONG. and you are not allowed to wait elsewhere. They did bring us a free chai latte inline 2 which was great. We sampled all sorts of things trying to steer clear of too much spice. The attendant in queue 2 helped us through the menu and all of her recommendations were spot on. Our waitress also helped with her favorites. We grabbed a handful of plates to split between two of us and loved getting to try different things. The manager even stopped by to ask what we thought, gave us some history of the restaurant and was extremely friendly. All in all, I dug the vibe, the food, and the staff. If you're in London give this a try. You will get an authentic Indian food experience."
4/11/2015,5 star rating,"Dishoom! Lives up to its expectation and ratings... Is it an overpriced place? YES.. Is is always crowded? YES.. Does it live up to all the hype it's created? YES.. Is it worth it? Dishoom! YES! Thanks to fellow Yelper's who made the decision extremely easy for what to order... Priced a bit on the expensive side for the really small portions you get... it might annoy you to find a small little bowl of Okra Fries (£3.70) and Prawn Koliwada (£5.90).. But have a bit of these extremely well seasoned appetizers... and ... DISHOOM! They got it spot on.. Really nice flavor and you'll definitely enjoy it! For entrees... Chicken Ruby is clearly a winner. We saw a few tables order Biryani and Choley Bhatura too; but most of them were hogging on the really delicious (albeit smaller portions) of this dish.. again, priced a bit on the steeper end at £8.20. Roomali Roti's go extremely well.. so definitely recommend that! Few things to remember.. they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait! We waited ~50 minutes on a Wed night at 7:20. After we got in, they strategically send you downstairs to their bar where they'd expect you to spend a few more £££'s on drinks.. in about 15 minutes, you'd be taken to your table. For a place already minting money, this was a bit unnecessary in my opinion! Service wise, no complaints! In fact, the food comes out really quick after placing your order. We got our food within 10 minutes! Definitely a must experience place for the Desi & Videsi crowd ;-)"
28/8/2019,5 star rating,"Delicious! This place is in demand. I went to the one near Trafalgar Sq. It is a touristy area but it is delicious and worth it. Bombay style Indian food. We got cheesy naan and chutney, okra fries (these are probably the best thing on the menu???), rice and kebab, and black daal. For drinks we tried chai and watermelon sharbat. There could be a long wait. We got in and were seated right away. Right after us a long line formed, Disney-style. I wish I could eat here every day."
15/10/2019,5 star rating,My favorite Indian in London. Drinks and everything we ordered was great. They also did well working with restrictive diets and were helpful making suggestions. Worth the wait.
1/10/2019,4 star rating,"Not a big Indian food fan but I was told I just had to have Indian food when in London and this place was the place to go.   Got to the restaurant on our first night there, a bit jet lagged and tired only to realize they had an hour line to wait in outside.  We decided to wait it out.  Time passed by quickly talking to friendly people in line, and the restaurant sent someone out to give free cups of chai tea and mint tea to those of us waiting in line, which was a nice touch. We actually were seated after only a 30 minute wait, and we ordered the vegetable Somosa appetizer which was a veggie and spice mixture inside a small pastry.  It was very flavorful.  Followed this with the Ruby Chicken, which was pieces of tender chicken in a red curry sauce and an order of their garlic Naan.  The chicken was flavorful and everything you'd expect a red curry dish to be.  The Naan was good but sadly did not taste of garlic.     Although Indian food is still not my favorite I did enjoy the food here and would recommend ."
29/5/2018,5 star rating,"Had an amazing first Dishoom meal here recently, and very happy to recommend it to all. We came for breakfast, and I sincerely love the vibe and decor of the place. Our service was friendly and very attentive, and they kept the house chai flowing which was fantastic! We got the Kejriwal and the Keema Per Eedu. Both were quite tasty, especially the Keema (which had a stronger flavor). I was sad to not have enough stomach space to try out some of the naans. Most of all, I loved the decor - from all of the photographs, to even the decor in the restrooms, to the giant clock going backwards (""it's on Bombay time"" - our server) it really has a lovely atmosphere that feels special and unique."
23/12/2017,4 star rating,"This was one of our better meals while in London. I had heard great things about Dishoom, so I bookmarked this restaurant prior to my trip to London. Unfortunately, the only time that I could visit was during the morning, so we opted to try the food prior to our trip to Buckingham Palace. Luckily, we got there before the brunch crowd, so we were able to be seated right away. The menu didn't have a ton of choices, but I decided on the Big Bombay breakfast, which included eggs, beans, sausage, bacon and some rolls. It was a relatively simple breakfast (and a lot of food), but everything was nicely cooked and flavorful. Paired with some orange juice, this was a good start to the day exploring London. I would definitely want to return, next time I am in London, to try dinner."
4/5/2019,5 star rating,"Two different friends recommended this restaurant before my trip to London and I'm so glad I listened to them.  My friends and I showed up on a Monday night to find an hour wait.  We had theatre tickets and couldn't wait so came back the next day for lunch and decided to stick out the 45 minute wait.   All of us agreed this was the best Indian food we've had.  My personal favorites were the grilled pineapple and paneer and the ruby chicken (a traditional curry dish).  We tried the grilled potatoes, samosas, chicken tikka, rice, naan, and a salad.  Nothing disappointed."
12/9/2019,5 star rating,"Disclaimer: I'm just a simple dude from Southern California. The hype of Dishoom is so very real. The food is amazing. It's well balanced, cooked perfectly, and is incredibly appetizing. My mouth is watering just thinking about the food. The servers were nice and I felt like I was eating at a trendy restaurant in LA. I think it's a great combination of the great Indian food you can find in London and the service you should come to expect at a trendy LA restaurant. I remember waiting almost an hour for the meal and normally, I wouldn't do it. But I had to see the hype. It was definitely worth it. I recommend Dishoom if you're around the area!"
27/10/2019,5 star rating,"It's the BEST Indian food that I have tried so far! Worth the wait! Host and servers were super friendly and considerate! The server not only moved the big party away from us for more privacy, but she also apologized for the noise at the end! Ruby chicken was crazily tasty！！"
3/4/2019,5 star rating,"Bistro-style Bombay restaurant with excellent food, great service and wonderful late-night international vibe. Fresh Nan constantly being made in the kitchen. Much care taken to deliver very flavorful dishes including Tandoori, curries, biryanis and house specialty daal. Reasonable prices. Great drinks. What's there not to like?"
29/9/2019,5 star rating,"Went here twice in two days - first for breakfast then for dinner. We arrived a bit early for dinner, around 530pm. Good thing, because by 630 there was a line snaking out the door. I had the chicken biryani. It was very very good - the rice was slightly over cooked, so I would not rate it the best I've ever had (tbh it's pretty hard to beat a biryani made by a specialty mom and pop shop), but the service and atmosphere more than made up for any slight shortcomings in food. The waiter recommended pairing it with their special gin tonic, which was a spot-on combination. Bottom line - I would come back here again and again just for the experience and wow factor. Very happy with Dishoom."
3/10/2017,5 star rating,"Not an Indian food expert. We came here because we know London has amazing Indian food. My Indian friends told me it is much better than the food back home. From our yelp search, we made reservations here. Two stories and we would recommend reservations given how popular it is. We decided to be brave and order a bunch of things we never tried. PAU BHAJI (A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered, home-made bun, Chowpatty Beach style. No food is more Bombay. (V)(S)4.50) - This was boxed on their menu and I wanted some veggies. This was our favorite item! It was so flavorful! Can't believe its veggies! AWADHI LAMB (The lamb is prepared with stock and spices, then layered with rice and cooked in traditional 'dum' style. (S)10.50) - My husband loves BIRYANI so we ordered this. We ordered yogurt to go with it. They gave us a big bowl of it! The yogurt was really refreshing and delicious but unfortunately the biryani was so-so. Not as flavorful. HOUSE BLACK DAAL (A Dishoom signature dish -- dark, rich, deeply flavoured. It is cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony. (V)5.90) - Also boxed on their menu. It was our second favorite item. It is made from what I think is mung beans (or similar). You don't like mung beans then I wouldn't order this. DISHOOM CHICKEN TIKKA (A family recipe, using a marinade of sweet vinegar, not yoghurt. Laced with ginger juice, turmeric, garlic and green chilli. (S)7.90) - As close to the famous chicken tikka marsala you will get here. Came with 4 big pieces of chicken. Its not as creamy but good. It was a bit sweet for me. Garlic naan- we got one. You can get it buttered or not. It was good. Overall, it was a good meal. Unfortunately, I don't eat Indian food that often so I am no expert. Flavors were very different but good from the Indian food I've had in the States. Plenty of restrooms that is pretty nice."
6/3/2016,5 star rating,"My first time in London, first meal in London, and first time stepping foot in a modernized traditional Bombay-style cafe. Dishoom is beyond any Indian food I have tasted in the U.S. and has elevated my Indian food experience and a spectacular culinary treat. Despite the long queue, staff were very welcoming and friendly. At one point, the host came out to personally chat with us and the hostess even offered hot Indian tea and beverages for the awaiting guests. Well known for their breakfast and buzz for their fried eggs and Bacon Naan Roll, we arrived for dinner instead. Our waiter, Ali, was so helpful in explaining the menu, as everything just sounded so inviting and delicious. We ordered a full table, starting with the Bhang Lassi and Mango & Fennel Lassi drinks. Indian food is best eaten with Lassi as it balances the heat and spice from the curry. For the entrees, we tried the House Black Daal, Chicken Ruby (tender chicken in makhani sauce), Sheekh Kabab (grilled lamb) and dipping Raita (minty cucumber yogurt). I would recommend getting two orders of the stonefire Naan or the steamed Basmati Rice for dipping and mopping the rich, silky curry sauces. Ali also brought out 3 house-made dipping sauces, which really brings out the flavor of the meat dishes. Mouthwatering food and drinks, stellar customer service, clean and charming restaurant decor, all located right in the heart of London. Dishoom is so worth the 13 hour flight from San Diego. Cheers/Chiyars!"
15/10/2019,5 star rating,"This was probably the best Indian food I've had at a restaurant outside of India. Honestly, it's on par with the restaurants actually in India! Came with a small group for dinner after 5+ people recommended I head here before leaving London. The queue was a bit long and we were told it would be an ho wait, but we persevered. We ended up waiting outside for 30 minutes then being moved downstairs to the bar and given a buzzer to wait for our table. The buzzer rang after 10 minutes and we were in our way. We ordered the chicken tikka, chicken ruby, lamb samosas, garlic naan, lamb biryani, mutton pepper fry (chef's Covent garden special), okra fries, and lamb boti kabab.  Everything tasted amazing. All of the meats were well seasoned and grilled to perfection but still moist. This was my first time having okra fries and they were delicious. I'd say the absolute must haves were the mutton pepper fry, chicken tikka, lamb biryani, and ruby chicken (roughly in that order). The service was amazing and the restaurant was lively. It was a great experience and I definitely need to go back for more!"
9/1/2016,5 star rating,"My husband and I came here for dinner on a recent trip to the UK. We arrived around 5:30 PM and had to wait over an hour and a half to get in... But it was totally worth it. It was a cold and blustery day (don't worry, this isn't the start of a Gothic romance), and the waitstaff kindly provided mini cups of steaming hot chai and mint tea to warm us while we waited. Once we got in, my husband and I were seated downstairs at a tiny two seater table. Our waiter helped us make sense of the extensive menu and together, we put together a lovely meal. We had the lamb biryani (best I've ever had) paired with a light yogurt dip to cut the heat. We also has veggie samosas and fried okra. YUM. Everything was super and I was extremely impressed with the quality of the food. We washed down our delicious meal with a glass of mango lassi (also terrific). If you have the chance to visit, please do. It's well worth the wait. Oh, and the WC was pretty clean, too."
8/9/2017,5 star rating,"Found this place on Yelp while picking up some discount theatre tickets, and since we love Indian food and we heard the Indian food in London was amazing...this had to be tried. And oh boy was it delicious! We came in around 2:45pm local on a Friday, so it was a short wait...but after ordering the food (with some recommendations from the server), it was completely worth it. Specifically, the Chicken Ruby (their 'makhani' style dish) was off the chain, the House Black Daal was so so tasty, and the Lamb Boti Kabab was perfectly seasoned - extremely balanced and still juicy. Even the garlic naan was freshly glistening with butter! The only slight disappointment was the Prawn Koliwada - I think we expected something slightly different, and while it wasn't bad once the main dishes came out, we completely ignored it and crushed everything. This place is so so good!"
18/9/2019,5 star rating,"SO GOOD. When we have friends visiting from the states, Dishoom is always my first recommendation. Yes, you should expect to wait in line (usually 1 hour but always depends) and I promise you, it is so worth it in the end. If you want to try for a shorter wait, I'd aim to get there no later than 4:45pm. Without a doubt, you've got to try the Black Dahl (creamy, flavorful and unlike any other dahl I've had. It's one of their specialties!). I also highly recommend the Pau Bhaji. It's vegetarian dish, and I wasn't too keen on the description but a waiter once recommended it so we thought we'd give it a try. Now it's a must-order every time we go! And the drinks!  Highly recommend the Hoppy Butter Paanch. It is exactly what I'd imagine a Butter Beer from Harry Potter tastes like :) Five stars all the way."
27/5/2019,3 star rating,"Interesting art deco interior design and great service. Apart from a special old fashion that I ordered, nothing is too impressive IMO. The food is rather mediocre than special."
18/7/2015,4 star rating,"It wasn't even 5 pm and this place had a line outside already.  Granted, this resto is smack dab in the middle of tourist mecca in London, so you really can't fault it for brimming with tourists. With all the accolades it has received at Yelp, Zagat and TripAdvisor to name a few, a long wait here is inevitable. We got lucky though 'cause we only waited about 45 minutes to get seated (with only 6 couples of in front of us or so it seemed).  Reservations for dinner are only taken for groups of 6 diners or more.  But here's the 411 on the seating process, just in case you think you're close to being seated when you reach the front of the line (you're not): You stand in line outside, and when you get to the front of the line, they may call you in inside and sit on the chair by the hostess podium, or they may just call you in and lead you directly to the bar downstairs to their basement, where they encourage you to get a drink, and where you have to wait some more. We ordered a couple of drinks (a Virgin Bombay Colada for me and a Nimbu Pani for the hubby), and studied the menu while waiting another 20 minutes down there. We were eventually seated just on the other side of the bar area.  This place is tight, so you will definitely be in on the conversation of the people next to you, whether you like it or not.  Here are the items we ordered: Naan--a bit disappointing.  It wasn't piping hot when it reached our table.  No blisters on it like it usually has and it wasn't elastic in texture.  More like a flatbread than a traditional naan. We should have sent it back and gotten a hot off the oven one. Dishoom Calamari--nice flavor, tender, but a little greasy.  A small portion but perfect for two people sharing. Kacchi Lamb Biryani--good dish, nicely spiced, very tender lamb chunks underneath the rice.   Kacchi Lamb Chops--ordered and enjoyed by the hubby.  The marinade has penetrated the meat and you get a very flavorful and tender bite. Enough for 1 person. Raita--good accompaniment for all the dishes we had and will cool your palate. We did not have dessert.  We were just too full from our dinner.  Service was friendly and good.  When we were standing in line outside the restaurant, a staff member came by with small glasses of Nimbu Pani (essentially a lemonade).  It was a warm day, so it was definitely welcome and refreshing. They're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so they don't close down at all in the afternoon.  If you can go in the afternoon, the wait times may be better.  When we were leaving the restaurant, the line was pretty bad.  There must have been over 15 parties in line. As good as their food is, I wouldn't wait in that line.  You're better off trying a mom and pop Indian restaurant that probably has as good, if not better food than this restaurant."
19/3/2018,4 star rating,"Food: 4.0/5.0 Service: 3.5/5.0 Value: 3.5/5.0 Decor: 3.5/5.0 Overall: 4.0/5.0 I was half expecting something completely amazing but half expecting to be disappointed with my first Dishoom experience given the general accuracy of Yelp but then also the reputation of cuisine in this city.  Lo and behold, Dishoom came in smack in between - the food was indeed done quite well, and I think there is price that the proprietors can take but choose not to.  However, I would posit that the rating would be just a tad lower in certain other cities.  #true"
9/12/2017,4 star rating,"I like the food dishoom has but the wait times tend to be ridiculous so would I Walt to eat the food there? No, but if there is no wait I'll gladly eat there The garlic Naan, paneer Tikka and paneer vegetable happen to be my favorite but come on guys, you need to add a malai kofta or something to your vegetarian menu"
9/3/2018,4 star rating,"Would you wait for 1 hour in horrid weather to get Indian food? Well, we did. So this was apparently supposed to be the best Indian place in London and I figured I had to try it on my weekend visit. Got there at 6 pm and the place had a huge line outside. No, they do not let you put your name on the list and go for a stroll. You have to stand in the line, rain, wind or shine. They do bring you chai and sherry while you're waiting though. Once inside, the ambiance was beautiful. They have amazing Indian decor. We ordered the chicken ruby, dal makhani, kheema pav and roomali roti. Every thing was spot on except Chicken ruby. Chicken ruby was sweet for my taste. Service was good and prices were very affordable."
4/3/2018,4 star rating,We came on a Sunday evening after 6 and there was a wait for 45 mins for seating 2 people. This location I felt was quite huge as compared to the other two. Dishoom is located in the heart of the carnaby street and has some delicious dishes to offer. The reason why I give this place a 4 star is that the wait is much longer anytime and any day of the week and there are very limited vegetarian options to try from. This is a street side food joint without a twist straight from Bombay as they put it! The food is good delicious but I still feel this place is a bit overrated. There are only 4-5 veggie small plate dishes to choose from but all are very flavorful. Still wish they had more vegetarian options to choose from. Coming back again if I crave for some street side Indian food.
3/2/2018,5 star rating,"Before we embarked on our trip to London, literally everybody we spoke to said we had to try Dishoom. With hype comes the slight chance of disappointment if it doesn't deliver, but guys, the Dishoom hype is real! We ordered the ruby chicken, which by the way, was so good we ordered two! It was basically a flavor explosion of zesty tomato and coconut creaminess. We paired that with cheese naan which you should absolutely order. We finished that off with the okra fries ( which I would trade for French fries any day, and that's saying a lot!). The entire meal at Dishoom was so memorable that I still dream about it from time to time :)"
30/4/2019,5 star rating,"I took a little tour of London through an Airbnb experience and my tour guide was Indian-American so I asked her for the best Indian restaurant recommendation and she sent me to Dishoom. I ended up going for a late lunch/ early dinner, probably around 3:30-4:00pm. That was definitely the perfect timing because as I was leaving the line to get on the list was out the door. I was able to be seated right away. Dishoom is a lot of smaller plates, meant to be shared. I was traveling solo but that wasn't going to stop me from trying several items. I started with Lamb Samosas, these had the perfect balance of filling vs. pastry. They were so full of flavor. I dipped them in the trio of sauces they provided as well, so delicious. Next, I had the House Black Daal with garlic naan, and the recommended bowl of greens. The Black Daal is the signature dish, so of course I had to get it. I'm honestly not even sure what was in it but it was so freaking good. It was packed full of flavor and it paired perfectly with the garlic naan. This was a nice serving portion as well. It filled me up but if shared with someone else I would recommend maybe another dish to share. The greens were also SO full of flavor. I was shocked how good these were. I was very glad the server recommended them. At the end of my meal, I believe the manager came to ask me how everything was. I appreciated him taking the time to come over and check on me. I ordered the Chocolate Pudding and a glass of Chai. The manager gave me the Chai on the house, which was very kind of him. They chocolate pudding was so delicious, I love the hint of chili at the end of each bite. The Chai was by far the best I've ever had. I posted a picture on my facebook and my friend who lives in India said that the Chai was served exactly how it would be served in India, in a glass, not a tea/coffee mug. Overall, I felt like I had a genuine culinary experience. It was the best Indian food I have ever had. If I lived in London this place would take all my money because I would eat here all the time!! I highly recommend Dishoom if you're in London."
19/9/2018,4 star rating,We went to dishoom for breakfast. It was a really nice place with a great ambience. We are from Mumbai so Irani cafe resonates with us. The ambience is lovely and the menu for egg breakfasts are phenomenal. For non egg eating vegetarians this place is a bit tricky as there isn't much. All in all still a very good experience. Very reasonbaly priced for breakfast.
8/1/2019,3 star rating,Came here after seeing the reviews. The waiting line was LONG but the food a little disappointed maybe because it was hyped up so much plus i like Indian food when its spicy and this place was a little bland for my taste buds Ambiance - GREAT Pricing - Average Taste - Average Service - Good
22/5/2019,5 star rating,"My family was visiting London for our first time (from California), and one of the most important & most anticipated parts of the itinerary was dinner at Dishoom. The food was incredible; the manager actually recommended we ordered the cheese naan to pair with a chicken curry, and it unanimously was everybody's favorite dish. The house IPA paired well with it as well! Of course, we ordered chai at the end of dinner and it was absolutely perfect. The service was unforgettable and made the whole dining experience so special for my entire family. One of the managers ended up giving us an impromptu tour of the place, and we talked to him for a while about the way the art in the restaurant represents certain parts of Indian history / decolonization, and how that related back to our personal history! I'll definitely have to come back here every chance I get, and if I could teleport every single person I meet who knows how to appreciate Indian food here, I would. Also, be sure to make a reservation to save some time!"
29/8/2017,5 star rating,"Wow....  When in Rome.....  or rather when in London you have to try Indian food.  Simply outstanding.  I sat outside so won't comment much on ambiance or decor although it looked great from what I could gather....  but the food was insane. I had the gunpowder potatoes which were perfectly prepared, and covered in scallions.  Deep flavor, well cooked...  just perfect. Chicken ruby is a must try... amazing flavor and rich sauce but the chicken is expertly cooked.  Moist and flavorful. Lamb kabob was also amazing and was another star of the show...   I finished off with the cheese naan and together all this made a perfect concert.. Amazing place and if you like Indian food you simply must come here and brave the wait."
29/5/2019,5 star rating,"By far one of the best restaurants we tried in London. All the plates are small, perfect to share. You may need a reservation so call ahead just to make sure tables are available, specially during lunch."
14/10/2019,5 star rating,Best Indian food I've ever eaten and I've traveled the world.  Flavorful beyond belief. The lamb chops are amazing as is almost everything else. Super gluten-free friendly with a separate menu.
12/6/2017,4 star rating,"Wow. I don't really eat Indian food much or at least, I'm not an expert on it, but wow. Dishoom was one of the highlights of my trip to London and, the food and service I received were worth the long lines. As everyone else is saying, I would recommend coming early to avoid the wait. I came a little before 6:00 pm and had to wait almost 45 minutes - mind you, I was by myself. The waitresses will also provide you with a little hot drink (chai tea?) while you wait outside. Good thing some fellow Americans were also waiting in line; they told me what to try and order as I had no idea what to get. They recommended me the Chicken Ruby with some Naan and a side of Basmati Rice. I also ordered a delicious and sweet Mango & Fennel Lassi. Everything was tasty. The Chicken was flavorful, rich, and deliciously spiced. The Naan and Rice complemented the Chicken and the sauce perfectly. Oh, and the dips...! Amazing. For 1 person, that was a lot of food. Plus, the service was exceptional. Would I recommend it? Of course. If you're visiting London for the first time, Dishoom is definitely a place to try!"
16/5/2019,5 star rating,"Wow, wow and wow. Let's kept it short, because your hands are getting super busy soon. If you can here by yourself or the first time. Chicken Ruby with CHEESE NAAN. Drinks are all really great' and if you came here for breakfast or lunch. CHAI ! House chai' just be causation you might not drink any other chai later. Tips. Come early for early lunch, or the wait is really long. Staffs are super welcoming and friendly. Plus Dishoom also donate to feed the children :) good heart and good cost'"
16/4/2019,4 star rating,"Dishoom was pretty good. The cocktails and service were great. However the food was a bit hit or miss. What i ordered: Viceroys Old Fashioned - amazing, slightly sweet, with a refreshing pour of johnnie walker Lamb kebabs - dry and a bit flavorless Romali Roti and Chicken Curry - the Roti was fairly standard and Chicken Curry was pretty good Daal - amazing. Rich, tasty, could be a meal in and of itself Portions are well controlled and allow you to sample a lot more. Love the ambience and plan on coming again to give it another try if I'm in the area."
18/4/2018,4 star rating,"Dishoom was our first dinner in London! It was beautiful weather so standing in line for about 40 minutes didn't seem like a chore! They provided us with lemonade in line and then sent us inside to the next part of the line, which was the bar area. Their seating/waiting system was really well thought out and seemed very efficient! We were seated in under an hour, which was our original quote time. The food was delicious! We tried a lot of entrees and were absolutely stuffed by the end. We ordered the paneer tikka & vegetable samosas to start, all were delicious. The flavor on the paneer was good! The chutneys that are served with the breads and starters are amazing! For dinner we ordered the Lamb Boti Kabab- grilled lamb, which was perfectly cooked and so tasty. The Chicken Tikka flavor was great, the meat is chicken thigh, so be aware if you aren't a fan of dark meat! The Chicken Ruby was also interesting and tasty- a sweet and spicy sauce, it was a unique chicken dish! We also ordered the Gundpowder Potatoes- SO GOOD, probably my favorite thing we ordered, a variety of spices that really was a perfect combination. A few naan bread as well! To finish we had the chocolate pudding with chili ice cream. I would say the food is well priced and tasty! They have a smaller menu, but that allows them to get food out quickly- if you are looking for a lot of the classics you won't necessarily find them here. Everyone at the table was impressed with the food. Service at our table is where our review turns a little negative. Service from our specific server was a little lack luster- we had to ask someone else for water that was walking buy with a pitcher. Our server left and went on break during our meal, and so we were left with no one to get our check or clear our table. We waited a significant amount of time and didn't spot her, but finally saw her come back in with take away food for her break after 25 minutes. Thankfully we were able to steal a waiter from another area to help us get our check. Overall it was a fun experience- I wish the service at the table would have been as stellar as the service during our wait! Food was good!"
17/5/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing!!! Even though we had to wait 2 hours, management was able to give us complimentary appetizers (great customer service). Coming from the U.S and as a south Asian myself, this was hands down the best Indian food I have had. Everything we received we were extremely satisfied with. Masala chai and any desserts are delicious."
27/5/2019,5 star rating,"Absolutely outstanding Indian food. We showed up for an early lunch and the place was just turning over from breakfast. We ordered a couple beers and then split the Chefs special (lamb curry), chicken tikka, veggies, and a chicken in a makhani sauce, with a side order of raita. All dishes had incredible depth of flavor and perfect amount of spice. The lamb curry was extremely tender with a great spice balance. The makhani was really tomato forward but was extremely tasty. Veggies perfectly spiced and raita was great to cool everything down. Truly some of the best Indian food we've ever had. Highly recommend a visit."
18/6/2017,5 star rating,"This was by far the best food I have had in London. I really was about to give up on finding something that I would sincerely crave once I got back to the states!  I don't remember the names of the dishes we ordered, but there will be a picture and the servers are super nice so they will know. The chicken tikka was so moist and flavorful. It went really well with the green and orange sauce!   The bean curry packed a lot of flavors but wasnt too overwhelming. I feel like I could eat it with naan or rice every day. The garlic naan was crispy and fragrant. Loved how well it was cooked. The other breadlike item was actually just like a tortilla so it wasnt too impressive."
21/6/2018,4 star rating,"After reading several reviews, I went to Dishoom expecting the food to taste amazing. We asked the waitress what to order and she told us her three favorite dishes. We ordered all three. The food was good but not excellent. The garlic naan was thin and burnt. We were disappointed in naan. The rest of the food tasted average, nothing too special. The mango lassi was okay, but I've had much better."
6/6/2019,5 star rating,Waiting 2 hours is not recommended. No they don't have our regular Indian Currys and all but other food was awesome. Their paneer was amazing Potato was also great.
30/5/2019,5 star rating,"FAV restaurant in London! Don't miss this Indian gem. Just be sure to get in the cue by 4-4:30pm to avoid waits of 2 hours. The food, service, atmosphere are 5 star!"
9/1/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing Indian food! Gah, never in my life have I waited in line for Indian food. Insane! But you know it's good if there's a wait... even at 4:30pm. My fiance and I waited over an hour to eat here! Like other Yelpers mentioned, after you line up in front of the door, the host takes you to the bar. I think it's kind of a dirty trick to get customers to spend money on drinks while they wait to get seated at the table. That rubbed me off the wrong way. On to the food... you must get the ruby chicken. The menu is so extensive, but we LOVED the ruby chicken, garlic naan, and one of the chicken skewers. I will definitely return with reservations next time!"
18/5/2017,5 star rating,"Several friends and I were out late at night in London when they suggested indian food and being in london where indian food is supposed to be the best, of course I was down. Stupid me tho thought this was going to be a quick and dirty meal or a buffet style like they have in the states but boy was I wrong...and gladly so! We didn't end up having it that night since I soon realized how popular of a place Dishoom is but upon entering and smelling the wonderful aromas of food I decided that we absolutely HAD to come back to try this place before we left for home! We were able to get a quick seat coming to this location for lunch around 11 and we ordered basically everything that was popular on the menu and that our waiter suggested! We got the chicken ruby, pau bhaji (10/10) would recommend, garlic naan, house black daal, and lamb shanks (not a lamb fan usually, but would also def recommend. the pomegranate seeds are a unique touch). for the three of us, we honestly planned to order so much more food since it is served tapas style but our waiter warned us (so sorry I forgot his name but he was wonderful!) that it would be a lot and he was definitely right, we were SO full! The decor of this place was adorable and everything is so nicely presented. it's also priced really well for the food you get! I will DEFINITELY be back on my next trip across the pond, I already miss it SO much just typing this!!"
16/10/2018,3 star rating,"varunmurali.com/blog/dis… Irani cafes have this inexplicable homely feeling about them. I absolutely love going to Kyaani with my brother back in Bombay. At Kyaani you have to get the buttery bun maska, spicy and juicy chicken farcha with the delicious gravy poured all over it, and of course the timeless salli boti. I've actually never been to an Irani cafe outside of Bombay even within India. So when I head about Dishoom a couple weeks ago I was stoked! So many people recommended it to me so there was little chance I would skip visiting this homage to Bombay's Irani cafes. I really wanted to love Dishoom, but unfortunately I felt a little let down. Though the menu was stacked with favorites of Indian cuisine, I saw few traditional Parsi dishes on it. They did have bun maska (though not for lunch) and keema pav and a few other classics. Dishes The keema pav was pretty delicious. Spicy and authentic. Complemented the hot buttered pav really well. I would have been content to stop right there given how filling and value for money that single dish was. My friend who I was eating with vouched for the okra fries. He was not wrong. They were super tangy and chatpata. Fried well and not oily at all. My friend ordered the pav bhaji. Not a fan. The bhaji was waaaaay too smooth. I strongly believe you should be able to actually tell what you're eating in a pav bhaji. You need different textures to come through. The bhaji also tasted almost too creamy. It felt more like a paneer makhani sauce than bhaji.   The chicken biryani was the biggest let down. Mild, bland, uninspired. The chicken was tender I'll give it that. Not much else going on with the dish. It was just mushy and the rice was over cooked. You can't keep me away from black dal. The menu featured it as one of their best items so we ordered it. Good, not great. Could definitely use a bit more flavor but the expected creaminess was there for sure. Oh and the rose lassis were pretty great! Would I come back? I think I would maybe once a month or so, but I would definitely stick to the smaller dishes and appetizers. Unless someone else at the table orders a main course that tastes good that is! I think the small plates are super value for money. They get you pretty full and taste great. Definitely worth checking out!"
25/10/2019,5 star rating,Really good Indian place for anyone visiting London. Reservation is recommended! Ordered a mango fennel lassi. It was yummy.
17/8/2019,5 star rating,"A colleague recommended this place. Obviously I did my usual thing of checking Yelp for reviews. Upon seeing that this place is the most reviewed restaurant in London, and with over 4 rating on Yelp, I was both excited but also a bit skeptical. I've been burnt by yelp reviews before. Anyway, food was fantastic. Best Indian food I've ever had. My Indian colleague who came with said it's very authentic. They definitely are not shy about using spices. In the US, you tend to get dialed down versions of Indian food. Eat here and thank me later. Anything on the menu is good. We got a few things, which I can't remember the names for. The lamb stew thing was super good."
12/4/2017,5 star rating,"Outstanding. Dishoom's the best Indian food I've had in the world, hands down. Some may say it's better than what they've had in India (I would agree, but I've only been to Sri Lanka). It's tough to get a table, so definitely book in advance. The staff is as friendly and helpful with choosing dishes, so do take advantage of that. Literally every dish was incredible and fresh - it really opened my eyes to what Indian food can taste like with great ingredients. I got the chicken masala, various naan, and some starters. It's pricey, yes, but you get what you pay for! Definitely worth the effort if you want to plan a great meal London - won't disappoint."
15/7/2018,3 star rating,"This place was OK, but way overhyped. It is a well-decorated place, and the food was decent - but as expensive as it was (about £30-40 pp), and as long as the wait was (2 hours!!), I wouldn't do it again. The ruby chicken was the best thing we'd ordered. The paneer tikka was the runner-up for me."
24/11/2020,5 star rating,This restaurant was excellent! Beautiful location. Friendly servers. They served us right away and was patient with us as we decided on what to order.
23/9/2018,5 star rating,"My favorite place in London. I had original yogurt, it was awesome. So cozy and every staff are so friendly. I'd like to come here again."
9/5/2018,3 star rating,"We were told the wait would be an hour. They served us hot chai and sherry while we waited in line. It was maybe 20 mins before we were allowed inside to sit and wait for another 15 minutes at the bar. I had the BollyBellini - would not recommend, extremely sweet. Once we were seated, our server came over to explain the menu to us a bit. Due to the combination of the noise level in the restaurant with the velocity and volume of our sever's voice, I couldn't decipher what he was saying. Our food was good. The Mahi Mahi tikka was the best. The Chicken Tikka was super spicy. The server was busy and therefore the customer service lacked. When we were finished, he cleared our plates and we advised him that we didn't want dessert. We waited 20 mins at our seats for our check. We had to track him down to ask for it. We paid cash and were waiting for our change, he took our cash and disappeared for another 10 minutes. Overall the service really killed our experience, which is why I must give this restaurant a 3/5."
28/11/2017,4 star rating,"Incredibly popular Indian restaurant in the heart of London, Dishoom impresses with its variety of choices and flavors, but failed to wow me. Perhaps it was a little over-hyped and, to be fair, nothing was remotely bad but I didn't feel that Dishoom was particularly better than what I've had in the US, especially considering the price was somewhat expensive. I will say that the Ruby Chicken was absolutely delicious, but the Garlic Naan was nothing special. The black house daahl basically tasted like a bean dip. The Chicken Tikka Roll was excellent and unique. The service was nice here and while the recommendations were hit and miss, Dishoom is a solid choice in London."
15/4/2018,3 star rating,"ok so this is tough.Im from NY where theres no shortage of good indian food. Now orginally my wife and i were going to head to DUM biryani house but saw the greaaat reviews and number of reviews for DISHOOM. So i ll go thru pros and cons PROS- ambience is amazing. The lighting the old indians photos were superb touch The cocktails honestly were the best part of the entire experience.  I had an excellent manhattan and my wife a colada. So no issues there. Service was great. All employees were friendly.   To the food. Best dish we had was the chicken tikka off the grill. Tender and flavorful and with the chutney selection you could make as spicey or mild as needed Mattar paneer was good with excellent flavors and one of there signature dishes the black dhal was on point i must say. Cons- spicy lamb chops, first werent spicy and second they were overcooked. Cmon man there should be some red. We also got the signature prawn moilee in a yellow curry and it was just OK man.  I mean the shrimp was a bit over cooked. I wouldnt even say they were prawns. It wasnt bland but i did have high expectations. My wife ordered some coleslaw and felt the yogurt in their mightve been old. To summarize id say its a good place overall but if your expecting curries like some tikka masala vindaloo or saag .. yea not here. I mean im torn, i think people will enjoy the overall experience in general but really if youve been to other indian restuarants around the world this isnt even top 5 food wise. Go enjoy and have drinks and other small plates and judge for urself"
4/1/2018,5 star rating,"The BEST Indian food I've ever had!!! My boyfriend is Pakistani and loves Indian food and agrees with that statement also!! So good we went back twice in less than 24 hours. Small plates: We had the okra fries, lamb samosas, and keema pau- all SO amazing. The keema pau is Iranian and was soooo delicious- the lamb is flavorful and a little oily, which makes it go perfectly with the homemade bun that goes with it (which is toasted to perfection!). Mains: between the two days we tried the chicken ruby (twice!!) which is basically their version of butter chicken. It is honestly the best butter chicken I've ever had. We also had the chicken berry biryani which was delicious- the berries gave it a nice and different flavor. We also had the house black daal which was delicious, and I'm a huge daal lover. My bf also had the dishoom chicken tikka roll was very tasty also. And of course we had garlic naan with it all! Drinks: my bf tried the dishoom pale ale and thought it was really good! I also had the bollybellini which was very tasty, but definitely a sweet cocktail. I also had the baileys chai which was so delicious, perfect amounts of both and an amazing cream on top. Dessert: we had the dishoom chocolate pudding- so good!! It's more of a molten chocolate flourless cake, less like a traditional American pudding. It comes with a spicy chili ice cream which is so unique. Overall very delicious"
24/12/2019,5 star rating,We got high recommendations for this place on Google. And after checking it out online and here on Yelp I decided to get o the safe side and get reservations for our group of four. The Indian food was amazing and we all had a great time. The setting and atmosphere was very cook too. Advice: make sure to get reservations. I saw people waiting in the line and pitied them.
2/10/2019,5 star rating,Some friends of our booked a table of 9 and needed 3-4 weeks in advance and could only get a 4:45pm time slot. But the food was well worth it. We ended up ordering almost everything on the menu of which took the left-overs home and finished the rest the following day. There was a 1-2 hrs waiting line when we finished dinner around 6:30pm
19/11/2019,5 star rating,"Elite. Everything was amazing and to perfection. We did have to wait like an hour to get in but even from the moment we went inside to wait at the bar, we were taken care of and that whole experience with the atmosphere and the vibe was just perfect. the waiter was awesome and the food was just gorgeous. I don't think I've ever been into a place with everything including atmosphere, people and the food being that good, so highly highly recommend it was amazing definitely recommend!!!!"
29/4/2019,5 star rating,"Upon entering we were greeted at the small desk by the door. We didn't have any reservations (at 11:30am) bit luckily there were a few tables open; it was getting busy already. We ordered a couple of drinks and food. Everything was great tasting, and spicy. I wish I could have eaten more. The restaurant itself is nice and clean, and the staff friendly. It is probably a little ""touristy"", but it is still a good place to eat. We walked past at dinner time and the line was out the door"
12/11/2019,5 star rating,Most incredible service of all time. So accommodating to food allergies. Amazing food! Absolutely delicious.
18/7/2019,5 star rating,A friend recommended Dishoom and I'm so glad my mother and I decided to come. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. It was a hot day and there was a short wait outside of the restaurant. They gave us complimentary drinks. Not sure what it was but tasted like a limeade. We were seated downstairs and we ordered vegetable samosas as an appetizer. I ordered mattar paneer and garlic naan and my mom ordered macchi tikka and cheese naan. Everything was soooo good and good portion sizes. The cheese naan was great! For dessert we shared a mango kulfi. It was so refreshing! Will be back when I'm back in the UK.
30/4/2019,5 star rating,"Impressive flavors, impressive ambiance and seriously knowledgeable and friendly staff. Can't wait to go back to London, just to visit this place again."
28/4/2017,5 star rating,"I can not believe what delicious food we had!  I'll be back every day this week despite the hour wait outside in the rain.  It's that good.  Ruby Chicken, Black Daal, Raita, cheese naan, and some sort of potatoes with ""an addictive chemical that makes me crave it fortnightly!""  Do not miss while in London!! But don't wait on queue in front of me .  They brought us deliciously warm chai tea while we waited outside - and they were attentive to us on queue by keeping us apprised of our personal wait time."
19/4/2019,1 star rating,"While the presentation and ambience were really nice and the chai during the wait was a nice touch the food was mediocre. The special pav Bhaji was volcanic with no flavor. The chefs special black dal was red, with an overpowering tomato base. Big let down considering the build up and the hour long wait..."
16/2/2019,5 star rating,"We waited 51 minutes, but was quoted 1 hour 10 minutes. Loved the gimlet! Refreshing drink. The cheese toast, fried Ochoa, vegstable samosas, and biriyani were very good. Nice ambience. Great place for a date!"
6/10/2017,5 star rating,"I'm so glad I went to Dishoom. The ambience, food, service everything about this place is wonderful. Be ready for long lines. I waited an hour and half to be seated but while you wait they give you yummy indian tea (chai) and mint tea. Once we got inside I was so impressed with the ambience it's completely different from what you would expect from an indian restaurant. I ordered the famous house lentils, naan, lamb boti, chicken ruby, and rose/cardamom lassi. Everything was good. When I go again I don't think I'll get the lamb boti. I thought it was okay. But everything else was spot on. If you love lassi you have to try the rose and cardamom lassi, you won't be disappointed."
16/9/2019,5 star rating,"Had a fantastic experience at Dishoom Covent Garden. We were a family of 10 and were seated right on time at a booth that just about fit all of us. The set menu for 10 had a lot of variety and our server went above and beyond to accommodate us, particularly since we had a specific food allergy that we hadn't noted beforehand, but somewhat surprisingly ended up being a staple ingredient in many dishes. Our server, Thomas, went back to the kitchen to get a full breakdown of what did and did not have that ingredient on the entire menu and the restaurant was willing to swap some of the small plates for us based on this assessment. Thomas also came back to explain which of the set menu dishes would be free of the allergen. We really appreciate his efforts and positive attitude. All of the food was delicious and portioned nicely. The appetizers on the set menu were a little spicy for my table but the entrees had a lot fewer spicy dishes. My personal favourite is the chicken tikka masala! Our table also really enjoyed the jackfruit biryani. The rice pudding for dessert was also really good. Definitely make a reservation! Set menu for tables of 10 or over."
29/9/2017,4 star rating,"I have to say--I didn't think the 45-minute wait on a Monday night would be worth it, but happily, I was wrong.  The service once you get inside Dishoom is top-notch and the Indian food is above average (had the black daal, the Chicken Ruby, the Roomali Roti and a cheese naan), but I'm not sure it was necessarily the greatest Indian I've ever had...maybe, in part, because I've been to India twice and loved the food on those trips. But then?  I had the lamb samosas for dessert.  Sweet Jesus, these were amazing.  The samosas canopy shells were fantastic, the minced lamb inside was tasty, and the three spices left on my table were all excellent. If I could make reservations here and know my seating time, I would have eaten here a couple more times to try other items on the menu.  As it was, very strong, but you can tell there are some very specific treasures on this menu!"
16/4/2021,5 star rating,The best Indian food London has to offer with a fusion twist.  We thankfully had to wait just 45 mins for an early afternoon dinner.  The wait after arrived grew to 2 hours!  Well worth every second of the wait. Got to try the Okra fries!!
17/3/2019,5 star rating,"The lamp chops are awesome. It's tender, a bit charred at the right places, and sprinkled with pomegranate. We also ordered their signature dish Black Daal, which is curry with lentils, and Chicken Ruby along with some naan and rice. It's worth the half an hour wait and we hope to go again!"
6/9/2019,5 star rating,Delicious mattar paneer and garlic naan. So good on a cold day! Chocolate chai is a must try if you visit.
9/9/2017,5 star rating,"I tried to go for Dishoom for dinner one night at about 8pm.  Forget it.  Liine out the door and waiting list was 1 hr.  Did I mention this was a Tuesday night.   Needless to say I did not give up, and came back on Thursday for a late lunch.    It was definitely worth it.  I had the fried okra which were very flavorful, a little to much spice for me but very nice.   I then tried the bbq prawns which were delightful, cooked on the tandoor, with the right level of spice and flavor, worth trying.   Then I went to the roomali roti with the house special chicken ruby.  This dish was fantastic.   A slight twist on butter chicken it had wonderful taste and was excellent.   This is definitely a place to go to when in trafalgar square.  The service is super fast, though the staff are clearly not experts in Indian food."
21/6/2019,5 star rating,"Everybody told me to come here at least once while in London. Absolutely agreed. We had the tiki chicken, black daal, and masala chicken. Followed up with ice cream popsicle. Everything was delicious and bursting with flavor. Make reservation beforehand to avoid the wait! We reserved for 5 PM, and got seated right away. The line outside is also shorter if you come early."
5/4/2019,5 star rating,"Start was fantastic. We were told it was 1/2 hour wait and truly was cold outside. Well just after about 5 minutes they check you in and invite you down to the bar where it is warm to wait. Good sales move! But a drink... make yourself warm and make us some money. Can't blame them! Food was very flavorful. The portions served are like tapas, so if you have an appetite, make sure to order accordingly. Otherwise service as excellent as was the food."
23/3/2018,3 star rating,"Well if you don't mind dining in the most modest of furnishings, a table and a chair between babies in strollers galore with noisy conditions--- and you like your meat well done & not succulent; and you are easily swayed into ordering 'extras' at the insistence of waiters speaking broken English, then DISHOOM is just the place for you! Me? I'm not planning a return visit."
22/12/2016,4 star rating,"Perfect place for a small group of friends from out of town! The wait: An hour and a half on a Friday night. First is the line out of the door. They kindly served us chai milk tea. Then, they led us to the bar where we waited another 30 minutes to get our table. Food: I was very lucky to go with an Indian food expert where she made all the orders for us. Very delicious! I love their vegetarian options as well! Service: Quite slow, but I understand because it's a Friday night so they were very busy. Our waiter kept disappearing when we needed him. Other waiters were helpful when we needed help. Tip: Free wifi!"
30/1/2019,5 star rating,"Worth the wait! Unfortunately there is no sign up list at this location so you'll have to stand in line to get in. On a Sunday night, we waited an hour. The Ruby Chicken is a must if you are a fan of butter chicken. This was the best butter chicken dish we had ever had! The favors were out of this world! Definitely the best Indian food my husband and I have ever had and we will be back the next time we are in London!"
28/1/2020,5 star rating,"Very long wait but it was worth it. Half the crowd were Indians. My friend had a dish spilled on him and they took care of it and comped his entire meal. My friend, of course, still tipped the waitress. Next time I come to London I will be visiting this establishment. I might have a friend wait in line 30 minutes before I come because that line was killer."
18/12/2018,5 star rating,"Some of the best Indian food I've ever eaten. My friends and I waited in line for an hour to get in because they don't take reservations and it was totally worth it! They serve you warm chai while you wait which is nice and gets you through the wait. It's totally torture to watch people eat through the windows so I recommend you make small talk with your date, friends, or other people in line instead. The DAAL! OMG THE HOUSE BLACK DAAL! Just order it. Actually, order two of the daal. You can thank me later. Everything was amazing but I still have dreams about the daal to this day. I would go back and just order take out of naan and daal and be set! And to top it all off the service was superb."
26/1/2019,4 star rating,"We walk in as a group of five with no reservations. The place is packed at peak dinner time in one of the busier Dishoom locations but somehow we found ourselves seated in 10 minutes. How we managed that I honestly don't know but we were there prepared to wait quite a bit as we were told there would be a longish wait so it seems it was just a situation of being at the right place at the right time. After giving our names, we waited outside with umbrellas that they loaned to us for the duration of our outdoor waits as they didn't want those waiting loitering inside near the door. After only a few minutes we were whisked inside. There, we waited for what seemed to be 30 seconds when we were relocated again downstairs to the bar area. From there, again, we only waited for a few moments and before we knew what was happening, someone came around to fetch us to take us to our table. They have a system going that appears to work and each area was overseen by a staff who was expecting us which made it so easy for us. Their dishes appear to be meant for sharing tapas style. We were starving and we ordered pretty much everything on the menu that caught our eye and we somehow still managed to polish off every plate. I did notice they had several vegetarian/vegan friendly menu options which we loved and our server was cheerful, friendly and had impeccable timing. For a busy restaurant, orders were trickling in faster than we'd anticipated and so we were in and out in a little over an hour without rushing which is pretty impressive. Regarding the food, I'm not gonna break down every single item we've ordered but flavors were there and it definitely satisfied the cravings. But I can't single out any one dish we had that night that particularly stood out for me so I was really happy we did not have to endure much of a wait. But I've been meaning to come to one of the Dishoom locations ever since my first trip to London (that was years ago!) and so I was pleased to finally be able to tick Dishoom off my list of London musts. Our luck with the wait, I'm sure, was a rare one-off occurrence that I know I'm not lucky enough to have strike twice my way. And with the abundant dining options in London, who knows when I'd be back."
8/3/2019,5 star rating,"Woah. One of my friends recommended this place to me, and I was incredulous. ""Why would I go get indian food when I'm in London? I should be eating english food?"" He proved be wrong. Please go here. I just luckily walked in for lunch one day, which was great especially cause they were still packed at 2pm. They don't make reservations so be prepared for a wait. The food was incredible. It was what I would call, indian-fusion. They had great twists on classic Indian dishes. For example, the mutter paneer, was lighter, and fluffier compared to the creamy consistency that you see in traditional dishes. I would have loved to come back here, but I ran out of time."
11/12/2016,4 star rating,"Beautiful restaurant located not too far from Piccadilly Circus. The inside is supposed to be like a intimate cafe in Bombay, and it does not disappoint with the lovely decor and detailed furnishings. THE WAIT The queue is really confusing. Get in line outside the restaurant, but make sure you find the person with the iPad to add your name to the official queue. We didn't, and it resulted in a lot of confusion from the staff of what to do with us. There are heaters outside and wiki, so the wait isn't terrible. Plus, they bring around complimentary mint tea and chai (so good!). FOOD ++ Lamb Samosas (4.90)- done really well with plenty of stuffing and a crispy exterior + Pau Bhaji (4.50)- reminds me of a sloppy joe. The meat stuffing is a tomato-based dish, and you stuff it into the little rolls. ++ Chicken Ruby (8.50)- one of the highlighted dishes here. Chicken cooked perfectly in a tomato-based sauce. + Garlic Naan (2.50)- really small, with only two small pieces. Less fluffy than I would like. ++ Prawn Moilee (16.50)- generous portion of giant prawns. + Basmati Rice (2.90) + Pineapple Pepper Crumble (5.50)- really interesting twist with the addition of the pepper, creating a nice sweet/savory balance. DRINKS ++ Chocolate Chai (2.90)- chai + dark chocolate ++ Naughty Chocolate Chai (6.50)- chai + dark chocolate + bourbon"
18/1/2020,4 star rating,"My best friend told me Dishoom was a must when she heard I was going to London last November. I almost didn't get to experience this lovely spot when I saw how long the line was to get in. It was a chilly day in London, but my sister insisted we wait. I'm so glad I listened, because the wait went a lot faster than I expected and the food was fantastic! We had samosas (they were smaller in size), dal, ruby chicken and garlic naan. Everything was so good. I asked the owner if they had any locations in the states and they said no. They did share they are trying to open up a restaurant in New York, so I may have to pop out that way... that or take another trip to London."
23/11/2016,5 star rating,"It's pretty much all been said already.  Absolutely outstanding indian food, with an awesome variety of flavors, spices.  I've been here 3 times, tried more than 15 different things, and absolutely loved all of them. This place also knocks it out of the park on service.  On the weekends, there's a big ole line.  However, they brought us tea and other refreshments in the line.  Very nice of them!  When you get down to the bar to wait for a table, the servers all already know your name and are quite friendly.  Bar drinks are good. So all in all: Food - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Great atmosphere - 5/5 My favorite restaurant in London, and my favorite indian restaurant in the world!"
9/7/2017,5 star rating,"My husband and I were in London for a long-weekend. I don't pretend to be an expert on Indian food at all, but I know good food, and this is it. We even went twice, when we're normally all about exploring new places, especially on vacation. This location always has a crazy line, even earlier in the evening, but they are so kind, and give free amazingly good chai tea and a sweet liquor that I didn't like but my husband did (I think it's a sherry variety). I noticed how they also seem to overestimate how long the line will take, so you are happy to be seated earlier (so they say 1 hour, it's really 45 minutes). To start, the food comes with 3 sauces. One is supposed to be more mild and is green and sweet. I loved it and found it very addictive. Another was more spicy, and my husband monopolized it. I don't remember what the third is, since we both were obsessed with our respective choices of sauce. The garlic naan was addictive - warm and perfectly spiced. The masala prawns are also perfectly cooked and spiced. I'm normally not that big of a fan of chicken (I think it's hard to cook well and is either too chewy or too undercooked, and usually not seasoned well). But here, the chicken tikka is perfect - tender, and perfectly seasoned with ginger and a delectable green sauce. I also had the chaijito which was very good. Some flavored mojitos are terrible - overly sweet with no complex flavoring. This drink was not like that - it truly was a good mojito with complex chai spices, perhaps the same ones in their hot chai tea, which is also very good.   All around great experience. Apparently it's a chain in London - wish it would come to New York!"
12/2/2020,5 star rating,"Dishoom is quality service, food & experience. There is a reason this place is so popular. If you find yourself in London try this place!"
26/6/2019,5 star rating,"I'd never heard of Dishoom before my recent trip to London.  I found the restaurant on Yelp and made my way there. Then I was greeted by an amusement style queue, which peaked my interest. So, I made reservations for the next day.   My mom and I loved the entire experience.  Everyone was very nice and responsive.  Everything tasted great! The Dal, grilled shrimp and of course the naan were my favorites!! I also loved the frozen mango dessert!! I'm still craving it! I will definitely return and urge others to go. Thanks for a great meal and experience."
16/12/2016,5 star rating,"My companion and I? We don't like Indian food. Even so, we decided to give Dishoom a shot since literally everyone ever told us to come and give it a try, so we arrived later in the evening, falling asleep because we were so tired. And boy are we glad we came. The menu is extensive - lots of somewhat smaller sharables for order. We got a veggie mash, potatoes, garlic naan, chicken, and quite a few other items for just the two of us, leaving quite a few leftovers for later on. Make no mistake however - leftovers were because we were completely stuffed, not because the food was bad. I can't speak for authenticity, but the flavoring was delicious and unlike anything I had had before. Though distinctly Indian, the restaurant improved on the flavoring and had a great garlic naan that lasted in taste beyond its warmth. The okra was also exceptional, and the worst dish may have been the lamb or the potatoes, which really says something - they were good too. The environment is also worth talking about. Its a bit like a transportation back in time, an underground bar and a nice sense of decor tying the place together. Come here, whether or not you like Indian food. You just may be pleasantly surprised."
3/2/2019,5 star rating,"If you want to know how much I love this restaurant, let me just say, someone said, ""Let's go to London!"" and I responded with a high five and ""DISHOOOOOM!!!!"" I literally dream about this place. Please go if you can."
9/11/2016,4 star rating,"THIS PLACE IS SO COOL! 4.5 stars. I came with my boyfriend around 2pm on a Tuesday and it was full, but there wasn't a very long line. We were seated in the downstairs bar area to wait, and soon enough had a table. The decor is LOVELY and quite stunning and gives the whole place a great feel. The service is also great! Pricing seems very fair, and the quality is wonderful. They are also quick to bring out dishes, too! Wonderful execution. We shared: -lamb samosas. YES. Just yes. So flavorful and perfect. So comforting. SO good. The sauces they provide as well are just great. -Garlic naan. Kind of cliche, but still super tasty. It was fluffy and flavorful and not TOO garlicky. Love. -Ruby chicken. This was somewhat spicy but warming and comforting and flavorful. I was super into this. -Chicken biryani. YES. JUST YES. This is so good. So flavorful and lovely and would go super well with raita. -Chai. This is next level chai. AND they give free refills! It's comforting (a theme here) and spicy in the best way. It is delightful. All in all, this is a great place and if I lived in London, I'd come here all the time. It's not the BEST Indian food I have ever had, but is ROCK solid and the whole experience is VERY nice. PS: The above dishes was a LOT to handle for 2 people. Be warned. No regrets!"
25/9/2017,5 star rating,"Went to Dishoom for dinner and breakfast, both were amazing! Dinner - black daal, ruby chicken, Bhel, Pau Baji (my fave). Flavorful and spicy! Breakfast - Akuri and Fruit and Yogurt, Fresh grapefruit juice. Great service, delicious food - must try if you're in London. Beware of the long waits on the weekends."
18/11/2016,5 star rating,"One of the best Indian restaurants in London (maybe one of the Indian restaurants in the world), and worth the wait! Don't come here unless you're willing to wait in line for 45-90 minutes, but on the plus side, they have space heaters outside to keep you warm, give you complementary chai, and they have free WiFi. So it could definitely be worse. I came here on a Friday night and waited in line outside for about an hour, and then moved downstairs with a buzzer where I had to wait for another 30 min or so. At least once you went inside and downstairs, you could order a drink and some appetizers, so it wasn't quite as bad. The line felt a little like DisneyWorld where you move to different waiting areas to help pass the time quicker with a change of scenery. LAMB SAMOSAS (£4.90) - Delicious samosas, I don't normally like lamb but I liked these a lot. The outside was nice, flaky and light, made with phyllo dough and not heavy. There were 3 of them and they were delicious. I would recommend. OKRA FRIES - (£4.20) - These were thin slices of okra cut into fries, and lightly covered with batter and spices. I like both appetizers but I liked these a touch more than the Samosas. It went well with the drinks. Would recommend these, I didn't want the bowl of these to end! AU BHAJI (£4.50) - A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered pau bun. The description doesn't really do this dish justice, but it was our favorite one of the bunch. There were 2 fresh, hot, buttered rolls and a bowl of vegetables that were mashed with spices. It doesn't sound that great, but it was so good, hearty, and comforting. Don't miss this one. BLACK HOUSE DAAL (£5.90) - I know this is a signature dish of lentils simmered for 24 hours, and it was good - I would definitely eat it again, but it was probably my least favorite of the bunch. CHICKEN RUBY (£8.50) - The curry was well done and the chicken was cooked well - spicy, but not too spicy. Definitely worth ordering if you like curry dishes. We ate this with naan and rice, but I'm sure it would be delicious with roti. GARLIC NAAN: Fluffy, fresh, and delicious. I'd recommend getting at least one order for the table. I wanted to get the Roti also, but between the naan and rice, we had sufficient carbs for the table. DISHOOM CHOCOLATE PUDDING (£6.90) - I loved this dessert a lot, but I like chocolate cake and spicy things, so the combo of a warm chocolate cake and a scoop of chili ice cream was my perfect combination. The chili ice cream is not as odd as you may think - it just has a hint of spiciness. Overall, such a fantastic meal at reasonable prices. Quality food, so many options to choose from, and even the long line was made better by being able to go downstairs and get drinks/appetizers, having free chai, and WiFi. I'd come back here on every trip to London and can't wait to have breakfast here one day. Brace yourself for the wait and make sure to add this on your list of places to eat in London."
12/3/2019,4 star rating,"An absolute must in London!!!! The atmosphere is beautiful- upbeat, busy, and perfect for a late lunch or early dinner. We went around 3pm and there was no wait for a table of 4 even though the restaurant was completely packed! The food was DELICIOUS! You can watch naan being made. The rose cardamom lassi is an absolutely must try. Everything was delicious, clean, and well presented. I took off one star just because I think the music, kitchen, and vibe of the restaurant was too loud for me. Otherwise everything was perfect!"
11/5/2019,5 star rating,"The best meal I had in London whole traveling! When friends from London asked where we ate and we told them this restaurant, they all knew the place and had such good things to say about it. Started with the samosas, which were so crispy and delicious. The filling was so flavorful. For dinner we had the ruby chicken- so amazing! Complex sauce and was so delicious over and with naan on the side. The daal has perfectly cooked lentils, and the sauce was absolutely delicious. Overall a delicious meal, and will hopefully make a stop again at some point!"
11/5/2019,5 star rating,"The food is some of the best Indian I've ever had, especially the shrimp, the lamb chops and the chicken ruby. The waiting is insanely long though, avoid going there without an appointment."
7/12/2018,4 star rating,"Dishoom is a must when visiting London. I visited alone and felt very comfortable. The staff was extremely helpful and funny...the bartenders were sweet to me and made my drinks extra fancy as I told them it was my last night in London! The drinks were extraordinary. I ordered the Paneer and cheese naan for dinner, which was good but lacked a little flavor."
4/1/2019,5 star rating,"We got lucky and had no wait... we also went at 10:00PM after a show. The vibe is very cool. It's like modern Indian. I was with a group of 4 and we ordered the following: 1. Dishoom Chicken Tikka 2. Lamb Boti Kabab 3. House Black Daal 4. Chicken Berry Britannia 5. Butter Bhutta 6. Plain Naan We got multiples of a few of the dishes above. The House black daal is incredible. The chicken tikka was delicious. Honestly everything we had there was cooked with immense flavor. My girlfriend ordered a dirty chai - I usually do not like chai tea (they are known for it there) it's totally worth it! If you are in London, this is a must!!"
23/1/2019,5 star rating,"just... wow A heaping Indian Irani Cafe spread at the Dishoom Covent Garden location in London was the highlight of my day this past weekend. Now I understand why Chicken Tikka Masala is the UK's national dish. The location was SLAMMED with a line coiling out of the entrance when we arrived at 3:45 PM, but luckily, my UK BoldBelly ambassador (shoutout @camillerobinson ) had made a reservation the night before. Even so, a long line can only mean one thing *** Up top (in the picture attached) is the star of the table, the Dishoom Chicken Tikka; a family recipe that uses a marinade of sweet vinegar instead of yogurt, laced with ginger juice, turmeric, garlic, and green chilli. The bits of chicken were moist, well seasoned, and prepared with a decent amount of fat still on them. While we (Americans...cough cough) are used to chicken often being dry, steamy, and stringy, these cuts were juicy and resembling tender cuts of pork in texture. I had to slow down and eat the other platters first so I wouldn't get too sad from finishing the last piece (RIP tikka ). Going clockwise from the Chicken Tikka is the Black Daal, which almost surpassed the Tikka in outstanding flavor. At a glance the bowl seems like a dull serving of refried beans, but it's possibly the most complex mixture prepared for lentils I've ever encountered. Nothing comes close to the carefully measured combination of garlic, star anise, coriander, cumin, fennel seeds, garam masala, butter, oil, onion, ginger, heavy cream, and an array of a dozen other spices that have simmered for 24 hours before being paired with the lentils. It can be eaten straight, or mixed with the Awadhi Lamb Biryani next to it. At the bottom are the spices and chutney, and the refreshing cool mint yogurt; and last, but not least, the Murgh Malai. Chicken thigh meat steeped overnight in garlic, ginger, coriander stems, and cream. Even if my friend had not made a reservation, waiting hours outside for a table would've been beyond worth it. 'Til we meet again Dishoom. ***"
10/7/2019,5 star rating,"This was one of the best meals I've ever had! The restaurant is so well-crafted. I went alone, and was seated in the downstairs area. Although the line was long, it was absolutely worth the wait, and once I got in I was immediately taken care of. I got the chicken ruby, a side of garlic naan, and a side of jasmine rice. I couldn't ask for more! It was a perfect portion for one person. I was in a rush to get to the theatre afterward and my server made sure my foot came out quickly and was very attentive. I had a great experience here and will definitely be returning."
2/6/2019,4 star rating,Great food. Loud inside. Better to sit up than downstairs. It was always crowded when we where there late afternoon with lots of people waiting. Always. This restaurant was a recommendation from a local. And the food was really delicious. We had a chicken dish. A lamb dish. A daal. Raita. And it was topped with fried okra and chili. Of course we also ordered naan.
6/12/2019,5 star rating,"I didn't get to explore London restaurants as much as I wanted, but I'm grateful I at least got to try Dishoom. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Get a drink. The viceroy old fashioned is one of the best cocktails I've ever had."
26/9/2020,3 star rating,Over hyped - the food is uninspired and not worth the queues. There is nothing wrong with it and but don't expect to be blow away by it.
14/1/2019,5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing food.  The atmosphere and decor is impeccable. The mixed drinks look like something concocted by alchemists. The sauces, flavors, and textures are beyond anything I've had. I e been here twice and will come back every trip to London. It's something everyone should experience."
9/12/2019,5 star rating,Truly worth the wait. The line was long and it was getting late but person after person told us it was worth it. Hands down... IT WAS! The flavor the experience. You're a fool if you pass this review and don't make your way to Dishoom!

26/2/2017,5 star rating,"SO. F**KING. GOOD! We were visiting London for a week from Boston, and had already heard about the place. When we wanted to have dinner on a weekend night, the wait was 1 hr and 40 minutes, so we decided to come back during lunch on a weekday. The food was simply heavenly, and the price was very affordable. Fast and great service. Seriously, what's not to love about this place?!!"
27/10/2018,3 star rating,"Overrated and long waits, I had to wait almost 2 hour around 9pm. Service was okay, but understandable given how busy they were. Servers were running back and forth to places every second. The food was nothing special that everyone raved about. Ordered the naan, chicken tikka, chicken biryani and paneer tikka. All were just ok except the biryani. Coming from the Bay Area in CA, really spoiled with a lot of good indian food, this is definitely no where to the standard everyone speaks of. Overpriced and long waits, do not go"

5/4/2015,5 star rating,"My hotel was about a block away and coming back from sightseeing, we realized we forgot to make reservations..It was a Saturday night and there was a long line out the door. For a table of two, they told us the wait was going to be an hour but we were starving so we ended up eating elsewhere. Definitely make reservations people! We then decided to come here for breakfast Tuesday morning before we left for the airport and boy was that such a great idea!! No lines, service was quick, waitresses were very sweet and accommodating. The interior was very warm and welcoming and the pictures on the wall gave off a Bollywood feel. Our cups of House Chai was never empty. Yes - they have bottomless chai and it was the best chai I've ever tasted. Onto the food.. - Bacon Naan Roll 5.20£ : my goodness, the naan was so good, the bacon was smokey and delicious, and I was just addicted to their chili tomato jam they put in the roll. Can I bring a jar of it home? - Big Bombay (akuri, char-striped smoked streaky bacon from The Ginger Pig, peppery Shropshire pork sausages, masala baked beans, grilled field mushroom, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns) 11.50£: it was essentially a little bit of everything from the cooked breakfast menu. Everything on the plate was so delectable. We finished the whole plate and didn't even leave a single drop of sauce on the plate. Fantastic prices, bottomless chai, outstanding service. I wish I had come here sooner! If I am back in London, I will definitely be stopping by here again.  My mouth is watering just writing about this review. Highly recommended!!"
4/10/2018,5 star rating,A must visit in London. It's not exactly a chain but they have a few locations. if you come upon one...just go. It's worth. Prices are fair but the bill can get pricey due to the tapas type of menu. Everything's to share (think azn dinners). The lamb is a MUST. I've visited each time I've been to London and it's been perfect each time. A top 3 pick for me!
22/10/2018,5 star rating,"Heard about Dishoom from a friend who traveled to London recently and they really hyped on the quality and the wait time haha. If you are feeling peckish around 3-4 you can get in to Dishoom without any wait on a weekday (we did at least). The interior decor is definitely a highlight of the experience, because there are so few places decorated with such authenticity and classic beauty as Dishoom. Its done in the old style of colonial Bombay and is really awesome to just sit and soak in. The food quality is quite impressive as well. We kept our dish selection limited as we weren't terribly hungry. but we had the pleasure of enjoying the Ruby Curry & the Black Bean specialty dish with two garlic naans. The chicken inside the ruby curry was perfectly moist and very well cooked. the Garlic naan also was not overwhelmingly garlic flavored and was a perfect balance to the flavor of the curry. Mango Lassi is a definite pickup if you are here. Would come back."
23/3/2021,5 star rating,This is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. Worth the wait. I visit London a few times per year and my team knows I'll eat at Dishoom at least twice per visit! I talked it up so much to my wife I was afraid I was going to disappoint her when she joined me on a trip....NOPE! She loved it! Went twice with her as well. A few years back I had a layover at LHR and convinced a tired colleague of mine to chance our connection and take the train into Dishoom. Made him a convert too :)
22/3/2015,5 star rating,"Dishoom came highly recommended by a friend. Fortunately she mentioned there could be a long wait - and there was - 1.5 hours. We arrived around 7pm on a weeknight. Was it worth it? Absolutely! Not only was it worth it but we came back a few days later for a late lunch and a shorter 40 minute wait. There was amazing and their specialty cocktails, all of which we tried, were unbelievable. And, it's not very expensive. Good food, good drinks, what more can we ask for? Service was attentive and they brought around mint and chai tea while we were waiting outside. We tried Indian at a few other London restaurants and they did not stack up to Dishoom. If you like gimlets try their specialty gimlet! Best I've ever had. Celery bitters is the secret ingredient. You will not be disappointed and you'll be glad you waited."
28/7/2019,4 star rating,"This is my go to place when I have friends in town that want to try good Indian food. They have an incredible number of options in their menu. I typically take a cocktail at nice restaurants like this, but their Mango Lassi and Chai Tea never make it past 5 minutes on the table before I've finished them. For starters, I always get at least 2 orders of the lamb samosas, but if you're a vegetarian the veggie samosas are also as tasty. For main dishes, the jackfruit biryani and black daal complement each other as the black daal provides a warm sauce that softens the dry jackfruit texture. My only complaint about this place is how popular it is. It sounds like a good thing, but the line out of the door isn't the only line. There is first a waiting room inside the restaurant where you can order drinks and crisps. Typically the wait here is around 30 minutes. Then once this fills, people start waiting upstairs near the bar area. Then after that the line begins outside. The line outside is typically around 50-70 people long on a busy day. It's just impossible to depend on getting a table within 30 minutes, but when there is an open table it's like you won the lottery of the day!"
6/7/2017,5 star rating,"I really do think Dishoom has spoiled me for Indian food! The only time available for a Thursday night reservation for 4 was at 5:30- that's still considered to some a HH, but the place was already packed. Started with Vegetable samosas, garlic naan, and pau bahji all AMAZING as well as the condiment sauces with the samosas. Chicken tikka, prawn moilee, and house black daal were all cooked to perfection. Alin was our server who took the time to explain the dishes and encouraged us to share- he was very knowledgeable on all the dishes and kindly asked if there were any dietary restrictions within our party. No room for dessert but will definitely return again....and again! I had touched on reservations prior, make sure you book them. On our way out, there was a line of patrons half down the street- that should show you how great Dishoom really is!"
2/11/2019,4 star rating,"I thought that this restaurant was actually just okay as far as indian food goes because it's kind of expensive. Their spicy lamb chops (not that spicy at all) were delicious and their Chicken Ruby (similar to butter chicken) was also phenomenol. When you arrive, you will have to sit outside and wait where you can help yourself to chai tea. It was actually pretty tasty and I'm not a huge fan of chai. As the restaurant starts to clear out, they let you sit down at the bar downstairs. It definitely made it seem like time went by faster. I thought the black daal was a little bland. It just tasted like stir fried beans (but they're lentils). The garlic na'an was tasty. I just feel like it's a bit too pricey. You get two pieces with one order. Overall, the restaurant is well decorated and they have some tasty menu items. I just wouldn't want to spend this much money on it. Just getting a lamb chop and the chicken ruby is more than enough."
4/7/2017,5 star rating,"100% would recommend. I already know that I will be coming to this restaurant every time I am in London - maybe even more than once on any given trip. The chicken biryani with raita was so good. I can't even comprehend how the rice was so, so good. I've lived in India and had a lot of Indian food, this stuff is amazing! My friends live in London and have been here multiple times. Everything they have had has been amazing. Reservations only for groups of 6+. Worth the wait though!"
30/9/2016,5 star rating,"Yes, the wait is real.  Check in with the dude with the iPad and find your place in line and plan to wait.  We were quoted 1.5 hours Saturday night for three people, and we got in at about 1 hour.   The roti is perfection.  Their chicken entrees are crazy flavorful. Loved their bread with cheese and chives.  The fish kebabs were also flavorful.  The daal which is what they've been heralded for was actually my least favorite dish out. Basically order whatever your serve recommends and is in a box on the menu -  you can't go wrong!"
8/6/2019,5 star rating,Nice hearty breakfast on a windy day in London! A bit of queue although but worth try. Recommend!
9/7/2018,4 star rating,"I live in the Bay Area and we love our Indian food so I knew we had to try Indian food on our London trip. This place came highly recommended and we decided to go for breakfast. I immediately noticed this restaurant is decorated and serves food from more of a colonial perspective, whereas in the Bay Area, it seems more homey. I guess this isn't too much of a surprise given the history between the two countries. We had: -KEEMA PER EEDU: A Parsi power breakfast: spicy chicken keema studded with delicate morsels of chicken liver, topped with two runny-yolked fried eggs and sali crisp-chips. Served with home-made buns. This was my boyfriend's dish and he loved it. Said it was better than the typical versions he had of this and that the buns were delicious. -DATE & BANANA PORRIDGE: Organic porridge oats cooked with milk, banana and sweet Medjool dates We weren't sure what to expect with this dish but both really enjoyed it. The banana gave it a fresh flavor and the dates sweetened the porridge without making it too sweet. This is free refills but honestly, one bowl was enough for the two of us. -EGG NAAN ROLL: Two fried free-range eggs with saffron-yellow, runny yolks. Warm and most gratifying I ordered this because it seemed unique. It was but the sauce may be a bit sweet for some. -Chai tea: pricey but delicious I really enjoyed this spot and will have to come for dinner next!"
21/3/2019,5 star rating,"The wait was worth it! The food was delicious! Bombay style Indian food that's sure to please! The prawn curry was definitely my favorite, I practically licked the bowl!  We ordered quite a few dishes for 2 people, even the waiter was impressed we ate it all. The dessert popsicle was also very good! Recommended!"
19/4/2019,5 star rating,"We've done both breakfast and dinner here and can attest that the ""hype"" is real. We got here around 9am and there was no wait! The breakfast portion was big; and filling, and the unlimited chai was a really nice surprise. The grilled bread with seasonal fruit jam was also a favorite. At around 4:30pm, we had a 15min wait but we were lucky and was able to wait at the bar. On that note, Dishoom seems to consistently have a long line/wait all times of the day but I found their queuing system to be very organized and expedient. For dinner, we had the house dhal and I can admit that I didn't love it. The flavors were just ok. On the other hand, the ruby chicken was delicious and so addicting! The sauce has a touch of tomato in it and was perfect for dipping with roti. We actually ended up getting two portions of basmati to not waste any of the sauce. For two people we shared two appetizers, two ""entrees"", two basmati rice, and one roti. It was the perfect amount of food. If you enjoy Indian then Dishoom is definitely worth a try."
20/11/2019,4 star rating,"Given we were in London and thoroughly searching for Indian food we decided to nix the more casual places and opt for Dishoom; so glad we did. The ambiance and vibe was upbeat and not overly kitschy. The food was not the more traditional neighborhood Indian flavors but a more refined type of menu. We ordered the lamb samosas which were in a phyllo-style dough rather than the more traditional bread-like dough. Very crispy and tasty. Next we had the chicken ruby (makhni) and DH ordered the lamb biryani. Neither of these dishes tasted like what we've had in otherwise great Indian restaurants but each of these dishes were highlighted in other ways that were equally impressive. Rich, tasty and not overly spiced and super fresh. Overall, a very nice dinner"
9/6/2016,5 star rating,"Before I finally got to visit Dishoom, I always wondered ""what's the fuss about?"" I now understand aforementioned fuss. I won't clutter you with a essay review as pretty much everything is already covered by previous reviews (they are spot on), so here's my lowdown: GET THE BREAKFAST NA'AN. So simple, yet revolutionary and absolutely brilliant. TRY THE COFFEE. It's no costa crap. GET A SIDE OF MASALA BEANS. Better than Heinz Baked Beans - I never thought I'd say that, ever. PREPARE TO WAIT. The secret it out, London and the rest of the UK now know about Dishoom so you may have a little wait, but by lord it's worth it! I love it. Will be back on each visit to the capital!"
18/7/2018,5 star rating,"Upper scale Indian food? Doesn't sound like a thing right...guess again. We're so used to hitting up the cheap all you can eat Indian buffets..that Dishoom atmosphere, presentation, and selection just blew me out of the water. There will always be a wait here... but the hostess stand makes up for it by serving hot chai and mint tea to those who are in line! Tasty as well. Took about 35 minutes to be seated so I was starved. We started out with cocktails, the bf and bro got the house beer while I gotta chilitini, spicccay but really all the drinks were very unique and delicious sounding... wish I wasn't a broke med student. We didn't want to eat too much but did anyways. Started out with the okra fries.. so crispy. The got the pav bhaji, Dishoom chicken tikka, and chole puri. The most flavorful was the chicken, very tender pieces and creamy curry. It was a little different, they put a lot of lime juice  in the chicken tikka .. was s different spin I've never seen before, but very tasty. I think the chole was the most underwhelming, couldn't compared to the chicken. Pav bhaji was flavorful as well but messy. Dessert we shared a malai kulfi, yum... a sweet end to a very filling meal. Expensive? Yeah but what isn't in Europe? Don't go here if price is an issue. But... you'd be missing out honestly, it's definitely worth the experience even if it's a one time thing."
6/8/2018,4 star rating,"Ahhh. The only restaurant I HAD to dine in while in London! Long wait in line, a second wait downstairs, and finally! Know this: veggie samosas were awesome. Sauces came out 5 min after samosas were delivered. Service was average. No smiles, just order and deliver food -service charge is automatic - water pitcher delivered to table of six was emptied by diners and not refilled. Foods are spicy - but very tasty!"
13/1/2019,5 star rating,This is one of the best Indian restaurants to have authentic Indian food. I have become addicted to this chain and I keep going regularly everyone I crave Indian food. The service is really quick. I went on a weekend and the even though the line looked huge but it took only around 15-20 min. The restaurant is pretty spacious. I will go to this place again and again and I highly recommend everyone else.
4/1/2019,4 star rating,"Wasn't all that impressed with the short list of items to order from but the chicken ruby was good and so was the tea. Prices are fairly reasonable and we got in for lunch about noon so there was no wait. When we left about 1:15 there was a line outside of 20+ people. I really don't see why this is rated so highly as it was only good and not amazing. To each their own though, right?"
22/9/2018,1 star rating,"My hubby and I came here because of how many good reviews this place has. When we walked up to the restaurant it looked very nice but noticed there was a long line waiting outside (not a good start since it was very windy and cold that night). A lady came up to us to let us know it'd be about 1 hr wait and although we were pretty hungry we decided to wait. Outside looking in we could see a long row of empty tables, which we assumed was for a large group who had reserved (funny I saw a review that said they don't take reservations...hmm?). We waited about 30 min outside. We then were lead downstairs to wait inside at the bar for another 20 min or so until we finally got seated upstairs. Looking around we still noticed the long row of empty tables with no group. The food honestly was not the best. I liked it but back in FL I've had much better Indian food with wayyy tastier garlic naan bread. Our server was very nice but didn't check up on us as much as we would've liked (that could be a UK thing though, since we are from the US the servers are always coming up to ppls tables to check up on them). The drinks were good though(1 star for the drinks) After about 10 min of us at the table finally we see the big group come in to sit at the long empty row of tables. I'm pretty sure everyone that was waiting outside in the cold could've sat at those tables and been done eating by the time that group arrived. I've never been to a restaurant where they reserve your table for more than 10 min for your group to arrive and have waiting customers outside in the cold. Even with all that I wouldn't have been so annoyed if only the food was to die for but it wasn't. It really wasn't all that great."
21/10/2019,5 star rating,"This place is worth the wait!  Extremely nice waitstaff and even serve the most delicious chai as you are waiting outside in a line that I hear commonly wraps around the block - and for good reason!!  After waiting almost an hour outside in the cool London weather, I was let in to go wait downstairs with a buzzer.  I had the Prawn Kollwada, Chicken Ruby, Steamed Basmati Rice, Basmati Kheer and a glass of Pinot Noir.  I wasn't a fan of the sauce that came with the Prawns but loved the sweet sauce - almost like a plum sauce that was served on the side.  I basically licked the bowl of the Chicken Ruby - the sauce I could have drank straight!  Keep in mind I flew into London from California and headed directly to this place and was eating of what would be am time in CA!  The Pinot was delicious and smooth.  I got the Basmati Kheer to go which was like a cooler rice pudding - I loved the berry compote and crispy sugar on top.  Hope to be back before I head back to the states!"
4/2/2019,3 star rating,"My first stop in London is usually some sort of ethnic food, because authentic Asian, Mexican, and even Italian food is what I miss most while living in Paris. Having heard the name Dishoom over the years, I figured that this would be the trip I'd try it. I didn't expect it to be quite so... busy. It isn't your traditional Indian restaurant with statuettes and tapestries, but it's not modern only in terms of décor. They speed you through this place, placing people at the bar to sip on cocktails or chai tea until tables clear up, and then checking on you multiple times throughout your meal to hurry you up and out the door, while acting as though they truly care about your dining experience. We sat downstairs in the midst of it all, almost tripping over peoples' bags and feet as we were led to our table. If it hadn't been for the chai and wafting scent of garlic and cumin I would have thought I were in a modern speakeasy: the dim lighting and dark wooden tables and booths suggested clandestine meeting point rather than family Indian. The chai was amazing. I don't think I've had a better tasting chai in Europe. And they have free refills! My fiancé ordered a mango lassi, which was thick as it should be, and topped with fennel seeds for a fun kick. Then we got to business ordering the food. Sharing is the way to go. The dishes are small, and among the three of us we split the chicken ruby, paneer in masala sauce, fried okra, cheese naan, a side of greens (snow peas and spinach with a thick, dark vinegary dressing), the house black dal, veggie samosas, lamb samosas, and basmati rice. Highlights were the paneer and black dal (with heavy notes of clove, if I'm not mistaken?), and the tender chicken ruby. The samosas were a bit bland, even doused with the chili, plum, and mint sauces provided in tiny pots. The greens were unimaginative, and the okra was nicely fried but not special enough. If I were to come back, I'd order paneer and chicken cooked different ways, the naan, and the dal. And the bottomless chai, of course."
1/8/2018,5 star rating,"The hype is so real. We got there at an off time and waited 15 minutes for a table. The host even brought us lemonade to help ""beat the heat"" while we waited - delicious. We ate inside downstairs and ordered the chicken tikka, vegetable samosas, garlic naan, prawns, and a meringue dessert, and tea.  Everything was exquisite. Possibly the best meal of my life."
15/11/2018,5 star rating,"Late spot after the theatre is worth it all. Booths, tables, sharing long tables makes it easy to get two for seating.  Having a place open till 11pm is great, full bar with exotic drinks makes this place easy. Door man up front to confirm your able to seat.  There's an upstairs and downstairs for more seating or private parties. The Loos marked clearly are also down the middle staircase.  Walked over after seeing Harry Potter at the Palace Theatre. Wait staff amazing, she explained the items asked if we had allergies and brought a dairy free menu!  I would back!"
25/1/2019,1 star rating,"Was so disappointed & completely underwhelmed with our experience there. They have a vegan menu for Veganuary & we tried almost all of it (dairy allergy). Waited in line for 40 minutes for overseasoned food & drinks. Best thing we had were the samosas. Potatoes were over seasoned & some dishes were super spicy & I like spicy food. Waiter should have mentioned the spice factor with young kids/tweens at the table & two dishes being almost identical when we ordered. What a waste of a meal, time, & good chunk of money. Don't believe the hype!"
29/12/2019,5 star rating,"Dishoom is always a stop on my list when I'm in London. For brunch their Bombay breakfast and Bacon & cheese naan roll are delicious. The Bombay breakfast is a good choice if you want a variety of foods (comes with bacon, sausage, bread, beans, tomatoes) but everything is seasoned well and compliments each other. The bacon naan roll comes with this jam-like sauce that adds a nice subtle sweet flavor. without that sauce, I would think the naan roll was basic but the sauce really elevates it. I recommend the ruby red curry for lunch, very flavorful and tasty. The lamb chops are also a good option, seasoned well and tasty! Overall can't wait to go back"
20/7/2020,4 star rating,Dishoom your dishes paner kari and biryani really delicious.
13/7/2019,4 star rating,"I've been to this place a couple of time in various locations throughout London (don't think there are that many thought :) ) and I always enjoyed the food there. Breakfast, I had a nice meal with friends and also a great Chai with nice spices in it to make it extra special. Like Daym Drops would say, it's a Chai that bites back! Dinner, had a chance to be there for dinner a couple of times in different formats and I enjoyed both the ""just order whatever you want"" format and they also have a preset menu where we just get a good amount of delicious food and just share it. I think that the service was good at the locations I went to and they have a good amount of options for whatever diet you have and whatever party you are with."
7/10/2018,3 star rating,"Cool atmosphere but to me I was expecting robust Indian food. The chicken ruby and black daal were bland in flavor. They said they had to ""cater to the masses"" when asked about dishes like Vendaloo. I just say this because it is the first listing under ""indian or bangledeshi"" food. This is more of a Iranian fusion joint."
24/10/2016,5 star rating,"Apologies that this review is a year overdue, but it is important to echo what no doubt so many others have said: Dishoom is a truly exceptional restaurant that provided what may have been the best Indian meal of our lives. Everything we had was stunningly, confoundingly good. But on top of that, the whole operation was excellently managed. The services was incredibly prompt. Eerily prompt.  60 seconds prompt. We ordered, and suddenly there were amazingly delicious greens at our table. Even the bar was well-considered; We enjoyed a fantastic whiskey cocktail that I still think about and smile. We also had a chicken tikka that the draft of this review describes as ""Best tikka ever."" This was one of the happiest meals we've ever enjoyed. Thanks to management and staff for creating such a thoughtful, delightful experience."
27/3/2018,5 star rating,"Besides the hour and a half wait, the place is tasty. Atmosphere is casual Food is awesome Buckle up for a long wait though.

11/4/2016,4 star rating,"I came here for breakfast this morning as I was in between meetings since 8am! I was so hungry and I have always been a fan of Dishoom, so why not try their brekkie menu. I ordered the big bombay and house chai. Woaaaaah talk about a big plate of food, a man beast portion to be exact! 4 rashers of streaky charred bacon, akuri - masala scrambled eggs, 2 shropshire pork sausages, masala baked beans, grilled mushroom, grilled tomato and buttered pau buns, and a side of ketchup in a small dish. I managed to eat majority of it, I loved the charred bacon - the slightly bbq, crisp in taste, the pork sausages were ok - nothing special. The akuri was my fave!!! So flavoursome, unique, the blends of spices mixed well and so yum with the buttered pau buns. Their bacon is soured from The Ginger Pig, and it's probably the best I have had! The house chai is definitely bombay style, slight too sweet for my liking, nonetheless perfect for a monday morning. Also they don't take reservations for less than 4, so get there quickly to enjoy the vast array on their menu. if there is 6 or more, do book, they will tell you off if you don't!"
11/3/2015,5 star rating,"Best for Indian street food. The Masala prawns are my absolute favourite, with a dash of lemon juice, just perfect. The naughty chai with Bailey's is so lush and smooth to drink. The house chai is always a winner. Love this place. The chicken currys to the juicy lamb dishes always a winner. And the salads too. Oh and the ice gola, taste a bit weird at first, but after a few spoonfuls you are in ice heaven."
31/1/2020,5 star rating,It wouldn't be a stretch to call it the best Indian food I have ever had! Absolutely amazing!
22/3/2016,5 star rating,"A meeting in London took me wandering past Dishoom, and with their expansion to Manchester soon, I just had to try it. For a Thursday lunch time the place was incredibly busy - always a good sign - so I asked for a table for 1 and was luckily seated straight away. I ordered masala prawns with a naan bread as a light lunch and they were fantastic!! I would definitely try them again. The front of house staff were friendly and didn't make me feel isolated when dining alone. I can't wait for Dishoom to come to Manchester now."
2/11/2018,4 star rating,"Let me start off by saying Pernay definitely set the entire experience for us. While visiting London for the first time didn't know where to go so relied on Yelp reviews for suggestions. Perney gave us so many helpful tips not just for food and drink suggestions (which we took and he was spot on) but also for other places to go while in London (which we took his advice on as well). The ambience was great, the service was great and definitely worth the 1hr 10 min wait. They provided chi tea while you waited and the time actually flew by. Overall great experience if you go make sure to interact with Perney he was at the door as one of the host. Definitely don't get turned away by the line it is worth it!!!"
31/12/2018,5 star rating,"Absolutely worth your time and money. Several years ago I was going through my ""Indian food"" phase when at some point I think I had too much of it. I completely stopped eating this type of cuisine. My wife, who LOVES Indian food sometimes manages to convince me to had some of it, but I just don't enjoy Indian food that much. Until I got to Dishoom. I had a pretty low expectation and went here just because my wife convinced me that we have to try Indian food in London. Plus, it's a chain, so how good can it be? Boy, was I wrong. It was *delicious*! I had the prawns, which were made to perfection - The sauce was terrific. Had some white rice added to it and it was one of the best dishes I had in my week in London. The spiced up cider was a nice addition - My love of Indian food is restored!"
5/12/2018,4 star rating,"Does the food make up for the long wait? Well, that is up to you to decide. But for me, yes it was. And that is saying a lot since I waited over an hour in the freezing rain of late December in London. It was my first time in London and actually is my first (and only, so far) Indian restaurant in London also. Went during lunch time and the place was jam packed (even the waiting area at the bar down stairs was full). However, once we were seated, our waitress came over right away and was extremely attentive through out the meal. She was friendly and explained everything on the menu to us. The couple that sat near us were extremely rude to her but she was completely professional and kept her cool. The food, of course, was the number on highlight. Unfortunately I'm writing this review a bit late so I've completely forgotten the names of the dishes but one of them were prawns in spicy sauce and OMG I want that right now. Everything was super flavorful and the bar has some interesting drinks choices. Food is a tad pricey, but that's London for you. Absolutely make a reservation if you plan on coming here because tbh, the wait was worth it for me as a first timer but I probably wouldn't be willing to wait on my second visit :p"
28/5/2018,5 star rating,"Such a great place! There was a huge wait outside for dinner (45min) but they came out and brought us drinks and little aperitifs. They have a dedicated gluten free menu and the staff is very well informed on the allergies. The cocktails were really good, if you can't find something on the menu, the barkeeper will make you something based on your taste. The food was absolutely amazing. It was served tapas style so you don't have to commit to one meal and even though it was super busy our food came in a very timely manner. Highly recommend this to satisfy any cravings for Indian food!"
18/2/2019,5 star rating,"So so good! Worth the visit and even the wait if necessary. You wont get a vindaloo or a madras but you will get great tasting Indian food especially if you like the ""off piste"" Indian experience! Strongly recommended!"
18/2/2019,5 star rating,"Where to even begin. My friend and I came to London for the first time and decided to try this place out. The service is extraordinary. When my friend and I arrived, there was a line out the restaurant and with good reason. When we were seated, the food was delivered to us less than a half hour and the dishes were impeccable! The flavors came together beautifully and the wait staff was incredibly attentive and efficient. The food tasted so fresh and I was surprised especially because we received our food so quickly. You can literally see one of the chefs making the naan and they came out perfect. Ahh I wish there was a Dishoom in America :( :("
28/7/2018,5 star rating,"I remember waiting outside in the cold for 1.5 hours, and then waiting in the basement bar area for another 45 minutes, before getting to eat, and nothing of what I actually ordered.  But this meal was still the highlight of my recent trip to London.   Wow is all I can say.  Think of any positive adjective that could pertain to an eating establishment, this place has it in spades.  Well, maybe except for prompt.  After the fact the interminable wait itself didn't even register as a rite of passage, that's how good this place is."
20/3/2019,5 star rating,"Wow! I had heard great things about this restaurant before visiting London, and it lived up to all expectations. Great service with knowledgeable staff, view of the kitchen making fresh food, and delicious drinks as well as food! The chai and chocolate chai were on point. My favorite dish was the pau bhaji. Thought I could handle the spice of the chicken tikka roomali roll - when they say spicy, they mean it! The desserts also looked amazing. There was a constant line out the door, keep in mind there are no reservations. Can't wait to visit London again and come back here!"
15/5/2018,5 star rating,"Make a reservation! The wait can get pretty ridiculous (2+ hours!), and you have to physically stand in line (I've seen it many times walking by). I mean, the food here is phenomenal and worth your time, but if you're visiting on vacation, you don't have all the time in the world to be spending it in line!!! Make a reservation! After 5:45pm, they only allow reservations for parties of greater than 6. However, if you have less than 6, you can still make a reservation for any time before 5:45pm. The inside is insanely hip and historic at the same time. I love the modern accents that feature decor that look like period-pieces from the 1920s. It also helps that you're greeted by the most aromatic and inviting smells as soon as you step foot into this establishment. The food speaks for itself. You won't be disappointed by anything you order. Some of the food is so innovative and different, but not lacking at all in flavor. I was so surprised that the chicken tikka masala did not have sauce! The chicken pieces were just expertly soaked/braised/infused/whatever with the flavors that the sauce is still discernible, even if you're not seeing it. It's quite an incredible culinary feat, if you ask me. Also, I loved seeing the open kitchen downstairs. So efficient, spacious, and clean."
7/3/2018,5 star rating,"Everyone always said London had some world-class Indian food, but I was skeptical as to how much it outstripped the States in this regard until I actually came. Dishoom is a wildly popular Indian restaurant with many locations throughout the city. My friend and I chose to visit the Covent Garden one as it was most convenient for us. We secured ""lunch"" reservations for 5:45PM, effectively making this an early dinner (and this is the way to go as they don't take dinner reservations, and the line was out the door for walk ins while we were seated immediately; the lunch and dinner menu are the same). We ordered the garlic naan, chicken ruby, and black house daal to share - a greatest hits of the menu, if you will. Everything was phenomenal, with depths of flavor that I never tasted before in Indian food, all melding together with none of the harsh notes that I've sometimes found NYC Indian food suffers from. Somehow even the naan was orders of magnitude better than the ones I've had in the US. Both of us loved the restaurant so much that we had to come back the next morning to try breakfast (and more lunch). We arrived and were seated immediately at ~11:15. My friend and I ordered a keema per eedu, breakfast lassi, and bottomless house chai. Everything was, once again, phenomenal. The keema is quite heavy and comes with two buttered buns. Even something as simple as the chai was great - I'd never understood the appeal of it until I had a glass here. Of course, we also had to order off the lunch menu once they started taking orders at 11:45 since it was our last day. For that, we split the roti, chicken ruby (again), and the pau bhaji. Once again, everything was amazing and we cleaned our plates. For dessert, we each had a kulfi, which was a nice, light way to end a large meal. Please bring Dishoom to NYC! Until then, I'll be dreaming about this place."
16/4/2018,5 star rating,"I LOVED this place. I actually came here the day after going to The Cinnamon Club and was shocked that we got double the food for half the amount at Dishoom. Also, the quality was much better here! First of all, they have a great waiting system. They gave us a remote that buzzes when your table is ready. When it buzzed, we went straight downstairs. I'm not sure what they use their upstairs for (maybe reservations) but they were directing all walk-ins downstairs. Second of all, the staff is amazing. Everyone that helped us was very kind. Our waitress, in particular, knew the menu very well and was very sweet. Third of all, the food was INCREDIBLE. I got a mango lassi and the Bedmi Puri. My dad got the Chicken Curry and an order of naan. They were both incredible and plenty of food for two people. The Chicken Curry, in particular, was very flavorful and pairs very well with both a Puri and naan. The mango lassi was my favorite part. It tasted just like we got it in India - very well done, sweet and tasty. I would recommend this place to everyone that visits London!"
3/10/2017,4 star rating,"Thankfully we made a reservation a week ahead, therefore we had no problems getting into the restaurant. The queue outside is big so better make sure to make a reservation! The food and the location are great. The only negative thing about it is that we paid a service charge (12%) and were given the bill right after we finished our desserts. We planned to have a few more drinks but no one seemed to care. Nevertheless it was good food and a nice experience. I suggest the nimbu pani a refreshing drink for everyone."
12/4/2014,4 star rating,"Came here for a late lunch - must have at least one Indian meal while visiting London!  Restaurant was packed and the wait was 30 mins.  Their manager was kind to bring us all a free small glass of chai tea - basically a nice milk tea with a good dose of cinnamon that perked up the senses! I ordered their grilled Dishoom Chicken Tikka with a side of basmati rice and garlic nann.  Chicken was light on sauce which I like, but intensely flavored, well seasoned and best of all cooked perfectly juicy.  Garlic naan was buttery, hot, and almost crispy - I liked the three dipping sauces that range from salty to sweet to barely spicy.  The rice came in a good sized bowl, and although plain was essential for accompanying the strong flavors. I passed on dessert but got a Virgin Bombay Colada - a nice play on a Piña Colada but it was green (perhaps from mint) with a nice topping of fennel seeds and other spices for effect.  Not bad!  Note that still water is charged by the bottle."
9/10/2019,5 star rating,"This is by far the trendiest, coolest, and most fun Indian restaurant that I've ever been to. I love Indian food and have been to many Indian restaurants all over the world, including US, UK, continental Europe, and Asia. Many have excellent food but they usually fall short on ambiance. Dishoom has a handful of locations in the UK, but in no way it feels like a chain restaurant. This specific location is in the bustling Theater District of London, nestled on Upper St. Martin's Lane along with many other trendy restaurants and bars. We were not driving, so I don't know about the parking conditions. This particular Dishoom is a larger venue that features patio seating, a large bar area, and a dining area that is a combination of tables and chairs as well as lounge-style comfy chairs and coffee tables. The food is a combination of Indian and Parsi cuisine. Parsi's were Zoroastrian Iranians that left their country to escape religious persecution and settled in the Bombay area of India. The bar is very busy and they make very good cocktails. We had one of our best dry vodka martinis at Dishoom. We did not have reservations, and on a weekday evening had to wait over an hour to be seated. We were however able to find a table at the bar fairly quickly and have some drinks there until we were seated for dinner. Most of the crowd appeared to be the after-work types. The plates were on the smaller side but all very tasty and and nicely presented. You may not find all the many curries that you come across at most traditional Indian restaurants, but they do offer a nice, large variety of grilled meats, curries, bread, and also gluten free and vegetarian alternatives. Our sever was very friendly, courteous, helpful, and attentive. And again, the ambiance and the mood rocked! Very trendy, cool, and pleasant. We had a great time at Dishoom and hope to be able to visit again soon!"
23/1/2019,5 star rating,"Very hyped- and for good reason too! Everything was amazing. As a an Indian person and seafood lover, I couldn't resist ordering the masala prawns and mahi tikka. There were others of course, but these two stood out the most!"
25/7/2018,4 star rating,It's always consistently good and the service is great. I especially like the calamari and both chicken dishes. Samosas On the other hand are nothing special.
23/7/2016,4 star rating,"Even though we were hungry, cold, and wet after waiting 30 minutes outside to eat Dishoom, I was still impressed with their Indian food. At the bar we ordered the lamb samosas, which were absolutely amazing and tasted exactly like the ones grandmother makes. I loved how the skin was crispy, thin filo and the minced lamb inside was flavorful. Once we got a table, we ordered the House Black Daal, Pau Bhaji, Chicken Ruby, Prawn Moilee, and the garlic naan. Everything that came out was delicious but my favorite was the Prawn Moilee, which had perfectly cooked prawns and perfect broth for dipping naan. Dishoom was definitely worth the wait and one of my favorite meals in London."
12/4/2018,3 star rating,Not worth the hour and a half wait. The curries and naan are delicious but having to wait that long for food makes me not enjoy it as much. The day we waited was also pretty chilly. We got there quite early 6pm and still had to wait an hour and a half. Def come at an odd time like 4pm if you can go beat the crowd.
31/12/2017,5 star rating,LOVE this restaurant. Visited while on holiday in London. Ordered the tikka masala and garlic naan. I went with a mild spice after I was repeatedly asked if hot would be too spicy. I would recommend going hot with the spice in the curry. It's a bit of wait even during the week. I believe I waited for 40 minutes but it was near the dinner rush. Would recommend avoiding the lunch and dinner rush.
14/10/2016,5 star rating,"We were visiting London from San Francisco and made reservations here for lunch. We had a party of 4. One of my friends recommended to try Indian food in London. The service was great and the food was really good. Definitely make reservations we passed by the following day and there was a long line waiting to be seated. We ordered samosa vegetable/lamb, house chai, mango lasse, fried calamari, pumpkin dessert, chicken tikka, mahi tikka, ruby chicken, garlic naan and their lentils special. The lentils were a bit spicy for me. My favorite dishes were the ruby chicken and the mahi tikka. We would definitely come back on our next London visit."
26/8/2019,5 star rating,"Yes! Definitely worth the wait. Food is delish! Service was good! Had good recommendations depending on what you're craving for. When I go back to London, i will definitely stop here again for some good Indian food."
9/10/2018,5 star rating,One of my favourite Indian restaurants in London. Food is fresh and has a modern twist.
20/11/2019,5 star rating,"Best Indian food I have ever had, period.  We came in the evening and had to wait outside in the cold about 45 minutes before being seated.  It was definitely worth the wait.  Even though the place was packed, the staff were all friendly and helpful.  The decor is nice and the bathrooms are clean.  Best yet, the food is amazing.  My husband and I shared lamb samosas, chicken tikka, grilled prawns, potatoes, and curry chicken.  All were excellent.  The spices on the prawns and potatoes in particular were so flavorful with delicious combinations of spices."
27/8/2019,5 star rating,"Everyone that's visited London will surely recommend this place. I was recommended by 3 different friends when I told them that I'm visiting London and Dishoom did not let me down!! From the wait to when we left the restaurant, I thought the service was impeccable. They offer you some chai or lemonade while you wait. Everything was good, but the dish I find myself ordering over and over again is...you guessed it, the Chicken Ruby. This is must try in my opinion. Highly recommend going!! You will get addicted."
26/10/2018,5 star rating,"Went here one day while visiting London.  Highly recommend!!  While I have been to many Indian restaurants, I almost always order the same things.  At dishoom they offer so many different dishes hat I have never heard of.  That forced me to try things that I've never tried.  It was all amazing!!"
11/1/2020,5 star rating,We didnt get to eat here since the line was crazy every time we passed by. Everyone in town raves about this place but they dont take reservations. I will eat here for sure next time Im in london.
2/8/2016,5 star rating,"Delicious black daal, buttered naan, okra fries, roti and ruby chicken. Great prices and worth the wait. I'll definitely return."
1/7/2018,5 star rating,I first heard of this place through Andrew Zimmerman show on travel channel. He never steers me wrong. I came with a friend on a Sunday in the afternoon. There was only about a 20 min wait and we were able to wait at the bat and even offered a free glass of sherry or lemonade while we waited. The food was fantastic and came quickly. We had the chicken and lamb bryani. It was amazing. Definitely suggest trying this place if you like Indian food or want to try authentic Indian food for the first time.
6/9/2018,3 star rating,"My wife and I went here during our last night in London because it had a good Yelp rating along with the other parameters we used. I thought the food was great and normally the pros and cons of the place would have evened out to a 4 star experience, but the waiter we had was so bad that the meal ultimately ruined what would have otherwise been a pleasant end to our U.K. vacation. Frankly I wanted to give this place 2 stars, but I'm restraining myself out of a greater sense of fairness and keeping it at 3 because I think overall this place is well managed and I can't justify dropping it lower mainly because of one waiter with a bad attitude. Thus, at the end of the day we sort of got what we paid for (3 stars), but it's not a place I'd really want to go back to or even recommend for others to try (3 stars). When we first arrived we reached the back of a line outside the door and the staff did a great job of managing our expectations re: wait time and I thought it was really nice that at one point one of the waiters actually came outside with complementary tea for all of us. One of the people in line with us talked about how one of his friends always wants to come to this place whenever he visits London and I really liked how we could see what people were doing in the kitchen. Then we got in and we had this waiter who seemed nice, but after the first glasses of water he never refilled them for us after being asked more than once. Thank God the food wasn't too spicy -- otherwise, we would have been in trouble! And he did that thing that too many waiters do where they hold you hostage with your bill and you have to flag them down, and this was getting pretty late on a Sunday night. Overall it gave us the impression that he just had this attitude of oh, these people are just American tourists, they'll never be back so forget about them. Adding insult to injury our bill had something called ""voluntary"" [tip/gratuity] instead of just charging an honest price for each of the items and managing our expectations instead of making us think oh wow, these prices are actually reasonable despite being in the heart of London. Negatives: -really small portion sizes -- this was to be expected and considering the prime location would not have been an issue if other basic things had been up to par -no complementary rice -- this is more of a critique of U.K. Indian restaurants in general, but really? It costs almost nothing to make rice and an Indian restaurant without free rice is like a Mexican restaurant without free chips & salsa Positive things: -Excellent fresh taste, about as good as one could expect of Indian food (psst! There's also a great Indian restaurant in Salisbury near Queen Elizabeth's Park that's even better. My experience in the U.K. is that restaurants in outlying areas are better in addition to being more economical and in London you're better off just going to one of the big grocery stores) -Great atmosphere, no complaints there -From a cultural standpoint I liked that they offered Iranian items -- the lamb was quite good"
4/2/2016,4 star rating,"Visited Dishoom in its very centrally placed location before a matinee performance of Miss Saigon. We ordered the Chicken Ruby, Pau Bhaji, House Black Daal, Roomali Roti, Basmati Rice, Garlic Naan and Matter Paneer. It was, as you might suspect, a lot for a party of three. But everything was wonderful, so other than portion control I really had no issue with our very large order. I especially liked the Matter Paneer! I'm not usually one for vegetarian dishes, but the sauce was rich and flavourful which fit my palate perfectly. The Pau Bhaji was good, but I don't really enjoy having fried bread as a ""bread"" so perhaps if you share my preferences, you could skip that. Service here was excellent! Our server checked in with us every once in a while, ensuring that we never ran out of water etc. My only gripe would be that it was a little pricey. One garlic naan is 2.50 and when that's converted to SGD, that's around 5 dollars! One naan in Singapore is probably half that price at worst. Oh well! All in all, great food, great service but not so great prices."
16/11/2015,5 star rating,"What just happened. Wow! Service I was blown away is what happened. I came in around 12:30pm and was seated right away. Greeted at the table, they explained the menu to me and were super helpful. As I was dining, I was asked by 4 separate waiters for a total of 6 times if everything was alright. They gave me 4 chai refills (server name was: Moali and the manager was Sarune). Suffice to say, the service was impeccable. I'd go back for the service alone, but getting on to the food.... Food As a traveler, dining alone is hard. Especially at an Indian or Chinese restaurant where everything is intended to be shared... Or for people like me who just wants to eat everything! I could just sample a small portion of the menu, and I had the calamari as an appetizer and balsamic rice + prawn curry. The calamari was deep fried and very sweet. I was instantly addicted despite knowing how bad it was for me. Superb. The House Chai was also amazing. I had studied abroad in India and this is the closest I've had to authentic Chai. Not too much sugar, milk and just perfect all around. Pro tip: there's unlimited refills until 5pm. The prawn curry was the house special and came with generous portions of gigantic shrimps. The curry was rich and flavorful... I could and did drink much of it by itself. And the balsamic rice... Spectacular. I don't normally comment on rice, perhaps desensitized as I eat it daily. There's something special about the long grain cooked with coconut milk. Lastly my meal was completely free. On Mondays, at the end of your meal, you'll roll a dice and have a gamble with fate. If you get a 6, your meal is on the house! I had no idea this was the case and thank my travelers luck to be here on a Monday!"
28/10/2019,5 star rating,"The Dishoom breakfast is divine. So much on one plate, so well cooked and seasoned! I stopped here specifically before my flight to get one final, excellent breakfast in London and it did not disappoint!"
21/7/2018,5 star rating,"I love the train station aesthetic here. Get the ruby chicken and the fried okra fries. Authentic Indian food that's at a reasonable price. Great spice level, not too hot."
7/2/2019,5 star rating,Our favorite restaurant in London. Every time we are in London we like to go there and enjoy their delicious food. Great atmosphere and good service.  We can't wait to go back!
14/3/2018,5 star rating,"We started with the fried okra and I found it perfectly crisp and delightfully tasteful. I also got the garlic naan to start and I enjoyed that as well. For my main, I got the Marsala prawns which were grilled to perfection.  We also tried the chicken ruby which melts on your mouth. The spices are unique and fresh. Loved the atmosphere and vibe here. Be prepared for a long wait in line. We came at 10:00 and waited about 15-20 mins. Regular wait times during their busy hours can be any where from 1-2 Hours. Attentive staff. Lovely!"
9/7/2018,5 star rating,"It was highly recommended that I try this place and someone even went as far as saying it was some of the best Indian food in the world. This recommendation did not disappoint, everything we got was absolutely delicious! The chicken ruby was tender, creamy, and perfectly sauce. The Black daal was perfectly coked lentils, the seasoning was amazing and  didn't even need the rice to soak it up. The naan was perfectly crispy and garlicky. We might have had to wait an hour to get seated, but it was completely worth it!"
7/10/2019,3 star rating,"Honestly, it was ok, nothing too spectacular.  Had to wait an hour or so in the line to get to a table and the lunch was was rushed.  The prices were fine for London but food was just ok.  If I didn't have to wait for an hour to get a table, perhaps it would have had another star but not 5 star since vegetarian options were limited.  They had odd rules such as no take out on the weekends and while they provided tea or sherry while waiting in the queue, the food was nothing to write home about. The non-alcoholic drinks were great though so worth a shot but be mindful of waiting in line to get in."
25/6/2019,3 star rating,"I've hear about this place about 100 times when talking about London. After my 5th time in London, I decided it was worth the 1+ hour wait to try this spot. I recommend coming here in a large group so you can try all the dishes. The dishes are small and meant to share, but going with one other person was pretty limiting in terms of our stomach. We ordered the biryani, naan (lots of it), lamb chops, daal and chicken. First, the waitress forgot one of our orders so we kept having to remind her, but that was ok if the food wasn't so dry. I really had high hopes for the lamp chops, but for that price point -it was tiny and super dry. Definitely would not order again. I think the redeeming items were the naan (super moist and garlicky) and the collection of sauces! The green one is definitely my favorite. The other items we had were either forgettable or not worth the price point so I can't recommend getting them. Overall, I would not come here again to wait an hour in line."
22/1/2016,5 star rating,"Long overdue review from November but... AAH! They don't mess with Indian food in London!! And when they say the English have the queue down pat they aren't kidding! We arrived to a line and had a lovely conversation with the hostess at the door. We were led inside and invited to wait at the bar, which was nice cause it was quite cold outside. We were seated shortly after! We ordered a good lot -- calamari, black daal, garlic naan, and another dish I can't quite remember. It was all so delicious and the environment so classy! The only gripe was that it was so loud I couldn't hear my girlfriend but this was definitely tops on our trip!!"
7/5/2018,4 star rating,"After many reviews and personal recommendations, we decided to venture out to Dishoom for Sunday dinner. The wait for two on a bank holiday, sunny weekend was average, but the queue kept moving. People have mentioned the lemonade that they serve in the queue: it's true, but it's salty. After being seated, my husband and I ordered the greens, basmati rice, roomati roll, the minced lamb and the daal. Hands down the best was the black daal and the greens. I could have eaten a whole bowl of the greens myself! The sauces and spices with each dishes are very carefully balanced and flavorful-- nothing was overbearing from the other and everything on the table was complimentary to the other entrees. After a long day of leisure outside and exercise, I highly recommend ordered one entree and one bread/rice per person. We threw in the greens for color. Fantastic and we will be back!"
10/12/2019,5 star rating,"Great food, especially the cheese bread. Had to wait over an hour in a queue, but it was definitely worth it!"
4/11/2015,5 star rating,"The ratings for Dishoom are legit as this is probably some of the best modern take on indian food I've ever had.   The only problem about this place is that the wait was pretty horrendous as you have to line up outside, and once you are actually in, the tell you to wait downstairs at the bar for your pager to go off.  Not a problem since the food was worth it.  At least while waiting outside, a waitress served us hot mint water to help us bare the cold weather.   Here's what we had: Black House Daal:  This is a very tasty dish if you like beans (if you don't, stay away).  I believe they used lentil in this one.  The flavor is kind of similar to Tikka masala with the starchiness of the slow cooked beans.  This dish is definitely very filling. Pau Bhaji: Tasty vegetable mash.  I wouldn't say this is a must order but it was definitely solid.   Prawn Koliwada: I like they way the spicyness and flavor are really exploding in your mouth.  This were some tasty prawns.  The prawns were small though... Spicy Lamb Chops: This dish was good as well but not a must order.  I wish it would have had more of a sear on it, but the flavors were there. Chicken Ruby: Probably my favorite dish of the night.  The chicken is cooked in a makhani sauce, which is basically Tikka masala with more emphasis on a tomato-cream base.  Mouth watering deliciousness here. Lamb Boti Kabob: These were good and had a nice marinade of chilli and ginger. Garlic Naan: This was good, but you'll probably want to put in 2 orders, unless you ordered as much food as I did for 2 people.   Don't miss this place as the flavors here are quite different than what you can find in the States.   5 stars."
13/1/2018,5 star rating,"I fell in love with this place. The staff was courteous and attentive, which made the experience more enjoyable. We had so many dishes (as we visited this place twice while in London), so I'll provide some highlights. Good: Chicken Ruby was tender and flavorful. Reminds me of chicken tikka masala. Probably my favorite dish. Pau Bhaji was amazing! If you don't like to share food then I'd order 2 of these dishes then proceed to eat them both. House black Daal is a must. Eat it up with their garlic naan at your own risk because you won't want to stop eating. They may have to roll you out the front door after you pay. Bad: Nothing"
16/9/2019,5 star rating,"Food is excellent. I recommend everything on the menu.  I think it's better to go for an early dinner like 4p/5p. The line is way shorter during that time. The first time we dined there, we showed up almost midnight and there was still 1 hour wait."
17/6/2016,5 star rating,"I can't comment on the rest of their menu but their brunch menu is amazing! I have been twice now and still can't get enough. First things first, the chocolate chai is to die for. The bacon naan is also simple but delicious, and the pao buns are warm and fluffy. And definitely get a side of masala beans with any dish you get which ties everything up nicely. The only downfall is the long queue, but if you make a booking (and you need to make those well in advance if you want a spot), you will breeze through and have your day made with some good food."
19/10/2018,5 star rating,"Yah it was good. I am always skeptical but when the chicken was so tender it flaked apart, I was impressed. The wait is long, but bring a friend to share."
6/11/2017,5 star rating,"We went to Dishoom the first day in London around 4:30pm and were told it would be a 1 hour wait. We decided to come back another day. Last day before leaving London we came back around 2:30 figuring it was between lunch and dinner so the wait wouldn't be too long. We were wrong; 1 hour again, but this time we decided to wait. So glad we did. The food was fantastic. We had the Pau Bahji, the house Black Daal, the Roomali Roti, Prawn Moilee, and the Mahi Tikka. They were all so good. Also had the East India Gimlet which was a very refreshing cocktail. The service was very good. As I said, well worth the wait."
25/7/2018,5 star rating,"I hate waiting for food. I see no reason to make yourself feel terrible when you can easily relieve your pain by walking across the street. But, Dishoom is the rare exception I will make. I came at 9 PM and had to wait 70 minutes to be seated, but after hearing the hype, I knew I had to verify. (also 1 hour is probably the furthest I'll be masochistic for) I ordered the jackfruit biryani, chicken ruby, and plain naan. I'd been starving all day, but wow this was incredibly filling. The ruby was my favorite. Think tender chicken with a rich, silky makhani sauce. Essentially a curry with spice and flavor. Smooth like butter. The biryani was great too - a veggie option to balance out the savoriness of the ruby. The sauces that came with the dishes were also incredible, with a spectrum of yogurt sauce and spicy sauce and in between. Overall, I appreciated the breadth and depth of the menu options as well as the accommodating items they served with them to ensure anyone will be satisfied regardless of taste preference. The restaurant was beautiful as well. They give you a newspaper like menu in a headline-like fashion featuring the different menu options, while giving an overarching background story about the restaurant's mission on the top header. Found it pretty cute. Even took it home for kicks and giggles to memorialize this visit."
25/11/2019,5 star rating,Another awesome breakfast in London! I was thinking about this chai since my last London trip.
19/12/2017,5 star rating,I love their breakfast as well as all day menu. I had the house chai and egg naan on this trip.
13/10/2015,4 star rating,"I was in London just for a few days and had to scratch my itch for some good Indian food.  Last night's attempt was a bust, and the long line outside of Dishoom seemed to be a promising sign (I would have gone here last night but the wait was an hour and 20 minutes). Ordered the Chicken Ruby, rice, and naan.  It hit a bullseye.  Yum. If you want to avoid the long lines come early, say around 5:30."
22/4/2018,5 star rating,"This place is sooo good! And cheap! I would definitely recommend this place for Indian food. However, just note that the wait can be pretty long. Recommend the Black Daal (lentils) and chicken ruby."
14/6/2016,5 star rating,"This is by far my favorite restaurant in London!! Great prices. Great food. Fast and exceptional service. I live in Los Angeles and just wish they would expand to the US. I dream about going back to London just to eat at Dishoom again cause there is nothing like it. I've been to Dishoom 3-4 times. For both breakfast and lunch. The breakfast is amazing with the limitless chai (although not sure this limitless applies to all locations). My favorite is the fruit and yoghurt. Which I don't know how they make their yogurt and have attempted to recreate. (I even bought a yogurt maker to make it and also googled various recipes to try - all to no avail). Their yogurt has the just right amount of sweetness to it with the honey and vanilla. With the fruit I could eat this everyday. The naan rolls (sausage and bacon) are amazing as well. I love the tomato jam in the rolls, that I asked the waiter if they sold the jam and sadly they do not but if they did, I would buy it. For lunch I agree with the other reviews. Bombay Colada. WOW and WOW. Again tried to re-create this drink at home to no avail. Just amazing. I could drink like 10 of these. Also agree the black house daal is one of a kind. Very flavorful. At Shoreditch I got the Lamb Raan Bun which was like a lamb pull apart sandwich. Exceptional. Overall Dishoom is just amazing. I think an exceptional restaurant is food taken to another level which makes it unique from others and to their own. Also to the point that you can't just go home and recreate it. You have to go there in order to eat it. Dishoom is both. Their food is unlike other Indian restaurants you have tried and in attempts to recreate it, I've tried and failed. I wish they would release a cookbook as I would be the first to buy it!!"
16/9/2018,5 star rating,"Wow! I cannot say enough about the food at Dishoom. I adore Indian food but my cousin, not so much. Even so, she thoroughly enjoyed the food at Dishoom. We ordered several items to share among our group of 4. Chicken tikka, Mahi tikka, Chicken Ruby, gunpowder potatoes, lamb samosas and 2 orders of naan bread. Our favorite dishes were the samosas, chicken ruby and potatoes. The chicken tikka had some grissle pieces so the quality of meat wasn't up to par and the mahi was under seasoned for my taste (and it's really tilapia). But the service was amazing and the side sauces were a nice addition to any bite. I loved the red spicy sauce on everything! I highly recommend this restaurant and the chicken ruby with a starter and some naan."
24/2/2016,4 star rating,"Fun menu. Delicious drinks. Great hosting staff (waiter was ok). Cute decor. I wouldn't wait more than an hour to get it, which seems to be about the norm during peak times. But it was good to try at least once."
19/4/2019,5 star rating,Best casual Indian spot in London. Make a reservation!  Place gets busy! Great place to share.   Atmosphere is of an old Indian rail staion!
6/9/2018,5 star rating,"Adding +spicy lamb chops and +bowl of greens to the list of things to order. The staff/service here is incredibly welcoming/friendly, accommodating, and thoughtful. Even with a constant queue outside the door, the staff never rushed or pressured us. Definitely recommend eating here."
4/4/2018,4 star rating,"I had heard so much about this place since I booked my tickets to London. Mostly all my friends recommended me to visit this place. I made reservations online, couldn't get any dinner reservations, but got one for lunch on a Monday. Once we got there, we were promptly seated. The service is just amazing, they charge 20% as service fee though. The food was good, not great. Living in San Jose, I think I have been spoilt and have many better food options available around. We tried the chili cheese toast, local beer, ruby chicken, rumali roti (which wasnt that great). Overall the food was pretty good, ambience, menu, service, drinks all pretty nice. Its more of an experience to go there and enjoy a meal. If you are looking for really good food, may be there are other indian places in London which serve better food as this was catered to the english taste."
31/5/2018,5 star rating,"Worth waiting in queue! I like the fact this restaurant does small plates. All the dishes were delicious and loved the general busy ambiance of the restaurant. We ordered the popular dishes: okra fries, chicken ruby, spicy lamb chops and garlic naan. Perfect amount of food for 2 ppl. I think my favorite was the spicy lamp chops. Crusty, spiced, and so tender. Definitely a must for visitors and locals alike."
8/11/2019,5 star rating,"This was the only time I have ever gone to eat, waited in queue for over an hour and decided it was more than worth it. The wait was so long because everyone there knows the quality and taste of Dishoom's food will have you wanting more as soon as the last bite passes your lips. I left sated and satisfied and will not hesitate to recommend and return upon my next trip to London."
5/10/2017,5 star rating,"Dishoom, please come to NYC -- I love you! This restaurant is a must for my husband and I when we're in town and with good reason. The food is extremely flavorful and the service is fab. The last time I visited this location with my parents, the bartender downstairs took care to provide them with descriptions of each and every cocktail and what made it special. I recently tried it for breakfast and immediately made next-day reservations at another location just so that I could try a different dish."
18/7/2017,5 star rating,"Byriani Byriani Byriani....the chicken one is the best I ever had!!! Yes we waited an hour in line...in the cold and yes it was completely worth it. They also passed out hot chai and mint tea to those waiting in line. Chai was the best i had... Got the naan (amazing buttery goodness)...and a lamb and chicken dish (forgot what they are called)..wish i got a sauce or curry based dish to pair along with it to sort of balance out our little feast but it was still divine. Portions are perfect not too big not too small(Ok maybe small for the states, if you are a fat American like myself get a couple of dishes). Couldn't decide between two desserts and I ended up picking one reluctantly..and our waitress brought us back both desserts and said the other one is on the house Sooo incredibly kind!!! They really treasure their customers. The desserts were soo good but I loved the chocolate one with the chili ice cream. My lord!!! I will definetely return to this gem on my next trip to London! I loved the vibe of the area too. A ton of young people!! And the inside at night is dark candlelit and relaxing."
7/1/2017,5 star rating,"This was the BEST Indian food I've EVER had!! And this is coming from someone who's been to India multiple times on family visits. I'd give you guys 10 stars out of 5 if I could!! First off, the wait to get in was over an hour; but seeing as this is surrounded by tons of other restaurants, that was a good sign. The staff was nice enough to bring hot masala chai and mint tea to people waiting outside in queue. Once inside, I ordered vegetable samosas followed by chhole bhatura. I mean, I'd heard about how great Indian food is in London but DAYUM!! This definitely hit the spot. If you find yourself in London, please don't leave without eating at one of their locations or you'll be missing out!"
9/6/2018,4 star rating,"My bf and I were touring London for 4 days and stumbled on this place on the first night. It was a Thursday and the line at 5PM was literally wrapped around the street. It was the longest line we'd ever seen, but it sure stirred some interest and we made a reservation for that weekend! From what we've heard from friends, it's not easy to get a reservation a few days away so we were pretty stoked. I think they take reservations until 5:30 so if you walk in before, there should be some open tables. I'm giving 4/5 because I found the portions small, but it is advertised as ""small plates""/tapa style so it's an opportunity to try a bit of everything. We ordered the murgh malai, lamb kabab, and some garlic naan. Everything was really delicious!"
1/10/2019,4 star rating,"Worth the 45 minute wait.  Great, friendly service.  Yummy food.  Will return next time I'm in London"
11/8/2017,4 star rating,"We arrived at Dishoom at a sort of peculiar time. It was a little past 11:30 am on a Sunday. We had less than 15 minutes to order from the breakfast/brunch menu, but were not allowed to order from the lunch menu for nearly 30 minutes. Reminded me a bit of my childhood, going to McDonald's and driving up to the drive-thru window and finding out that you were either too early for the lunch menu or just missed the breakfast items by 3 minutes. We opted to share a popular breakfast item, the bacon naan roll with the house chai, and stick around to be one of the first to order from the lunch menu. By the time we received and consumed the bacon naan roll it was indeed time for lunch. Having already a base of food in our stomachs we didn't over order, which seemed like it could have been easy to do considering the extensive menu and the desire to want to try everything. We ended up going with some Dishoom staples, the black house daal (lentil curry), the chicken ruby curry, and some garlic naan and roomali roti to soak up some of the curry goodness. We enjoyed both curries and the accompanying chutneys with our roti and naan. And, in the end, we felt like we came at a good time - we were able to try a delicious popular brunch item and beat the lunch queue that grew quite quickly at 12:00pm."
4/6/2018,5 star rating,"Really tasty Indian food with top notch service. Came here on a weekday evening and line was out the door with a wait time quote of 1 hr. I don't know if we were lucky or they usually over estimate their wait time but our wait was only about half an hour. Their dishes had so much flavor but my favorite was probably the chicken ruby, bowl of greens, and the lamb chop. I could probably do without the gun powder potatoes though. Thought I'd get really flavorful potatoes but it was just baked potato with a dipping sauce that didn't do much for it. I have to say their service was top notch! Our server Laura (I believe) was such a sweet heart who really took the time to explain the dishes and provide us with information and recommendations. She made us feel welcome and that's more than I can for a lot of our experience here in London."

30/6/2015,5 star rating,"By and large, London is known for having subpar food considering its status as a world class city. But the one culinary area they universally nail it is Indian food. Dishoom is a shining example of this. I've had my fair share of different Indian food styles. From upscale concepts to all-you-can-eat lunch buffets less than £10. Dishoom sort of does both. Elevated Indian fare that you'll pay something like £7 - £9 for. In a city that easily drain your bank account, it's a welcome respite. I had an array of different items from the menu. Many of which are identified in Yelp's review highlights. The black daal is special. The same goes for the the pau bhaji. But the star of the show was the ruby chicken. It belongs in some intersection of chicken tikka masala and a robust tomato stew. With juicy chunks of white meat chicken, it was understandable that everyone within a few tables of mine were ordering it with reckless abandon. Don't miss this if you know what's good for you. Paired with this bounty was one of the most enjoyable Negronis I've had in months. Being that gin has a huge footprint in this city, they know their botanical-based libations. One bugger is that you'll definitely have to wait to eat. Apparently the average wait is about 80 minutes. It's totally understandable that you'd rather just eat at Five Guys instead of standing around, but if you exercise patience you'll be rewarded."
19/7/2017,5 star rating,"Best indian food I had in London! Best to order a couple of dishes to share (the ruby chicken is amazing), but be prepared to wait for at least 20 minutes!  I went with my uni friend who recommended this and absolutely worth it."
12/8/2018,3 star rating,"The line up was an hour long so was it was it? In my opinion, no. Overall it was ok but I just don't see what the hype is about. You can tell it was full of tourists that come because the number of reviews. We had the fried okra and calamari for starters then the dahl which was good, the lamb chops which tasted a tad burnt then the cheese panner which had a nice tomato tasting sauce. The namm is a small portion. The place a machine, in and out."
30/8/2017,5 star rating,"+++ perfect Indian food (I thought I've eaten Indian food, apparentlyI never had until I've been here) ++ - Chicken makhni was superb with the perfect hint of spice - Black daal of a perfect complement to the makhni - Ive never had mango lassi like this one - Prawns were awesome and perfectly grilled; a little on the spicier side + - Lamb samosa was perfect G - Garlic naan was crispy, delicious, not too filling - Unlimited Chai tea - The colada with the rum! +/- - If you're into trying something new, try the Indian spiced cider...with ice lunch hours is less busy (we walked right in around 3, by the time we left at 4:30, the line was building)"
2/12/2018,4 star rating,"Great restaurant to dine at for a cheap price! Service was slow, despite us sitting in their downstairs area where there were much less people sitting. After waiting some time to put our orders in, it took quite some time to get our food. My order was wrong and when I pointed it out to a waitress, she immediately took care of it, and I was brought my correct order within minutes! So that I do appreciate. We ordered breakfast here which is served until 11:30, and it was very tasty!"
24/5/2018,5 star rating,"I've been here twice, once for breakfast, once in the evening. Absolutely superb, one of my favourite places"
27/11/2019,4 star rating,"The food was really good, but I took off one star for what I felt was a tacky, shady practice of making you wait outside for a long time only for a server to lead you downstairs to a bar area for you to ""wait"" for a table to open up. While I walked to the bar, I saw at least 6 open tables... What happens: As you wait, the friendly bartender naturally gives your party glasses of water and bar menus to look through before asking whether you want anything to drink. I'm sure you can decline to order anything, fwiw, but then you feel awkward for taking up a bar seat. To the restaurant owners: Listen, I loved the drink I got and the food we ate but the forcing mechanism of making you wait so that the restaurant can make more money made me a little annoyed as a patron. I would have gladly bought a drink to go with my dinner, but this was honestly annoying. While I admittedly don't live in London (but plan to come back to the city again), I will recommend the restaurant to my American friends because the food really was good (the daal does live up to the hype as does the mutton), but I will also caveat my recommendation to those friends tthis is a shady practice that the restaurant does. You might want to reevaluate this practice. TL;DR: daal and mutton were really good; one star off for shady practice of forcing you to wait at the bar to get you to buy a drink."
10/1/2020,5 star rating,"You will have to wait in line, yes. BUT ITS WORTH IT! The best advice is to go with a large group and order everything you want and share family style."
14/4/2016,5 star rating,This was a highly recommended to us and this place did not disappoint! Be prepared to wait in line for 30-45 minutes as it is a very popular spot. They do offer a small drink while you wait outside and once you're inside they take you downstairs where the bar is located where you can order a cocktail or two while waiting for a few more minutes for your table. Food plates are enough to share with 1-2 more people or if you're not sure just ask the server. The Chicken Rubi was our favorite and for dessert I loove the Memsahib's Mess pudding which is strawberries and crumbled meringue in whipped cream - so light and hits the right spot to finish off the delicious meal.
3/8/2017,5 star rating,"Oh my. I'm so happy I was introduced to Dishoom on my visit to London. There was definitely a pretty long wait (a bit over an hour) but I think it was very worth it. When you arrive you put down your name and at least one person per table has to stay and wait in line. While waiting in line, you will be offered a hot chai or water (definitely take them up on the offer! Especially if it is cold out!). Once you get to the front of the line, you'll be handed a buzzer and taken to the bar where you can order drinks while waiting for your table. Before you know it, your buzzer will go off and you'll be taken to your table to begin your amazing dinner. We ordered the chicken ruby, black dhal, spicy lamb chops, paneer, lamb biryani, naan (x3), and a bowl of greens. Everything was so delicious and my table of 4 finished off just about everything. I definitely wish some of the items on our table were a bit spicier (I LOVE my spice and was craving some heat) but overall, everything was great and I'll definitely be back to try some more items on the menu. However, I'll definitely be back for the biryani and the black dhal!"
17/7/2017,5 star rating,"One word: wow! The service and the food were so amazing. The line was a little long, it took us about 40 minutes to get seated. However, they offered us drinks in line (chai, etc) which was super great and convenient and complimentary. We ordered some drinks and samosas which came out so timely. The samosas were delicious and the chutneys were just the perfect kick. We ordered the dishoom chicken tikka, and honestly if you love chicken that's the dish to get. There is no curry with it so I would recommend a naan with it. But it was the perfect amount of spices tied with the perfect texture. Finally, we finished off with some kulfi (mango and malai) and it wasn't too sweet, but just the right amount. I recommend anyone who is in the area to try this place, you won't regret it!"
5/10/2015,1 star rating,"I can only postulate the kitsch of eating indian food in the heart of london and the assumption that a long line must mean great food has brought this place unwarranted attention.  The wait in line is about 45 min. as they refused to take a reservation from me when I passed by the restaurant earlier in the afternoon.  The other people in line (whether London natives or tourists, I don't know) and of course the two hosts at the door raved about the place and assured me that the wait would be worth it. First: this is NOT authentic indian food, north, south, east, west, or heart of india, pakistan, bangladesh, Afghanistan, what have you.  It is FUSION.  For those who already knew that, i'm just stating the obvious then.  For those who didn't, this is fusion, pan-indian, and likely not what you will find if you visited any of the above countries.   Second: the food is spicy.  I like spicy food, but it seemed to me that the vast majority of their dishes were spicy and there was not much variation.  Even the okra fries! Third: The kacchi lamb dish (cubes of dry lamb under a mound of rice) is by far the driest piece of rubbish I have ever tasted in my life.  I had to cut it up into little tiny pieces, douse it in their black daal before I could even eat the thing.  Utterly horrible.  I'm also not quite sure what the hype is over this black daal.  Not amused. Last: To end on a good note, service is very good as they are attentive and helpful.  In a city that makes you bleed money, this place is actually relatively affordable.  But overall, not worth the wait, not even for 45 seconds."
25/7/2017,5 star rating,"This is my favorite place to go in London - their prices are great and their food is absolutely amazing. I've tried a lot of different things, but I love their chicken tikka and their garlic naan. Also, their chocolate chai is to die for. Even though you can't get refills on the chocolate chai, if you order it BEFORE 5, you can get free refills of the regular chai, which is amazing. Every time my friends come to visit, I always bring them to Dishoom and they are without a doubt, extremely pleased and satisfied. There is typically a line, but I've found that if you go at around 11:45, there aren't a ton of people and you can just sit there until their lunch starts. Alternatively, my friends and I have gone at around 9:30, and we only have to wait around 40 min or so. I really, really love this restaurant and I would recommend visiting at least once in London!"
9/7/2018,5 star rating,"This restaurant server the tastiest dish we had experienced in our trip to London! It is Indian-British fusion, so the dishes were very imaginative. The naan wrap was excellent and I would highly recommend it."
24/9/2017,3 star rating,"This shop was super busy and I Waited for 1hour to get my food on table. Service was good while food has no any surprise. Among all the Indian restaurants I have ever tried, this one is just at average level. I won't say it's worth your spending life to wait for half or one hour. However, to be fair, this is one of the best food I had in this London trip so far....considering London is a good food desert, this restaurant to get high score is quite reasonable."
2/4/2016,4 star rating,"I walked around forever just to find this place considering my phone was dead, so this one was definitely an adventure. I'm glad i came though, yummy Indian food! ------------------------------------------------------- FOOD: Lamb Samosas: 4/5, We got this while we were waiting for our table at the bar. It was perfectly seasoned and a really good appetizer. You get three pieces so it's pretty small but definitely tasty! House Black Dal: 4/5, It was another really good item! Very different dal than what I usually have. Usually I get yellow dal but this one had much more full lentils and slightly thicker. I'm a big fan of lentil soup so I definitely recommend! Chole Batura: 5/5, This was my favorite meal of the night! The bread that comes alone with it is absolutely delicious, even better than the naan. It was a sizable portion and gave a very fresh feeling. Definitely get this dish! Chicken Ruby: 4/5, Another very decent dish. There wasn't anything wrong with it but it didn't stand out too much. It tasted very classic, so I would recommend getting it if you like chicken! Dishoom Chocolate Pudding: 4/5, This had a very very unique taste. I've never had a chili ice cream and it doesn't hit you at first, but the aftertaste is spicy. Although it wasn't 100% my style I would still recommend just because of how different it was. Naan: 5/5, I love naan and all the variations of naan here were delicious! ------------------------------------------------------- PRICE: Lamb Samosas: 4.90 Pounds House Black Dal: 5.90 Chole Batura: 8.90 Pounds Chicken Ruby: 8.50 Pounds Dishoom Chocolate Pudding: 6.90 Naan: 2.50 Pounds Cheese Naan: 3.20 Pounds ------------------------------------------------------- SERVICE: 4/5, It took like 30-45 minutes of waiting outside and another 15 minutes of waiting at the bar to get a table. It was definitely a very popular place, but once we got a table, they were very fast about getting our food to us! ------------------------------------------------------- AMBIANCE: 5/5, Very nice ambiance, definitely a little more classy but not too fancy. Can't really come in casual clothing, but it doesn't have to be too formal. Very good for a date! ------------------------------------------------------- OVERALL: I definitely recommend coming if you're a fan of Indian food or want to go on a nice date!"
8/11/2015,5 star rating,"Lovely place, excellent service and attentive staff. Didn't have to wait long during the day, but you may find a long queue during peak hours (lunch and dinner timings) Had the Pau Bhaji for starters (signature dish) Awadhi Lamb Biryani for and Chicken Tika for mains. More than enough for two! Food came within 10minutes, thoroughly enjoyed my meals here. Staff were really friendly and attentive  Seems like a good place for friends and family. Price: Depending on the size of your wallet, I found this a little pricey but worth the money"
3/7/2018,3 star rating,"After a 1.5 hour wait in a slowly moving line, we made it in (on a Wednesday evening)... lots of hype about the amazing food, and honestly it was unique- Anglo-Indian food, but not worth the wait... Authentic it's not... Service was great, very loud in there so don't expect to hear each other- and really by the time you get in all you want to do is sit down and eat so probably ok that it's not the spot to catch up!!!"
9/5/2019,3 star rating,"Most nights of the week (not during the high tourist season) there was a huge, slow moving line out the door. We managed to get in easily for lunch, however. We had a lovely dry paneer dish, muttar paneer, and samosas. The food was similar to the high quality Indian places we frequent, which is no small thing. But the ambiance is really haughty, and this attitude carried over to the servers. Also, given the prices, it is crazy they charge extra for a dish of rice. They prioritize trendy over friendly. The food tastes good, but to wait in a forever line to eat here and deal with the attitude would be insane."
30/9/2017,5 star rating,"My wife and I found our equivalent of food nirvana here at Dishoom in Covent Garden.   Admittedly it doesn't start well. When you arrive, if it's anywhere near a meal hour you'll find a line. However, I'm here to tell you that you must overcome any concern you have about the line, I don't care if it's raining sleet. Get in that line soldier and stick it out, the victory of incredibly delicious food will make the pain and suffering fade immediately. We had the following Buttered Plain Naan Black Lentils Lamb Sheek Kabob Paneer curry Vegetarian samosas We loved everything. While my wife and I prefer yellow daal, this black daal was amazing. The naan was very fresh with excellent flavor and a touch of crispy.  I could have eaten 3 orders of the Lamb without the benefit of any sauces, but the sauces are so damn good I used them anyway. The vegetation samosas were clear and away the most flavorful and balanced (potato to other ingredients) we've ever eaten, a great crutch in the crust followed by incredible flavor. I really wish I'd had room left to get an order of the lamb samosas. The paneer curry (that's right cheese pieces in curry) was terrific and would satisfy anyone regardless of whether they're vegetarian or not. The bar is where they send you to wait after you've made it in the door (3-7 mins) and they do a pretty good job there as well. We can't wait to head back to London so we can return to Dishoom."
20/3/2018,5 star rating,"Get here earlier than the dinner rush or you'll be waiting a while. Some of the best Indian food I've had and great service. Food: -PRAWN KOLIWADA: A bowl of delicate, crispy morsels with tamarind and date chutney. 6.50 -CHICKEN RUBY: A good and proper curry with spice and flavour. Tender chicken in a rich silky curry sauce, best mopped up with a Roomali Roti. 10.50 -PANEER TIKKA: Paneer is vegetarian first-class fare and a subtle cheese to make. Marinated then gently charred with red and green bell peppers. Not worth trying again, because there are so many other delicious things on the menu. 8.20 -HOUSE BLACK DAAL: Dishoom signature dish -- it is like a dark, rich, deeply flavoured lentil textured dish in a rich subtle sauce. You can tell It is cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony. 6.20 -JACKFRUIT BIRYANI Delicious, savoury jackfruit and delicately saffron'd rice, potted and cooked with mint, coriander and sultanas. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. So much flavor and was expertly executes. 9.5 -GARLIC NAAN With minced garlic and coriander sprinkle. It is one naan cut in half. Get more than one serving per person, you won't regret it. Dip into anything, including their delicious chutneys. 3.20"
17/7/2019,5 star rating,"This place can sure be hard to get into! But it was worth it (if you like this type of food) I loved every bite, but my less taste adventurous friend wasn't a big fan. We got so many dishes and shared them all. It wasn't huge portions, but it also wasn't overpriced. It was nice to get s few bites of so many different things. They have a cute bar downstairs you can wait in if there is room. After about 20 minutes we were lead to our table. It was a long family style table. They were able to make suggestions for us, and they had a separate vegan menu I was able to order most of our dishes from. Over all it was lovely and I would definitely go back, but with people who know they like Indian food! Reservations are highly recommended, but you can also wait in line outside for walk ins."
24/6/2018,4 star rating,"Dishoom definitely lives up to the hype!  Knowing London has some of the best Indian food in the world, I did my research before visiting from Las Vegas - which is by no means a hot-bed of 5-star Indian restaurants!   We ordered  Chicken Ruby = Dishoom's take on Tikka Masala, Garlic naan, and Roti (which reminded us of a large Mexican tortilla).  Everything was fantastic!  Highly recommended!"
4/10/2019,5 star rating,Absolutely charmed. American gone traveling and cannot recommend enough. The Hoppy Butter Paanch is like a holiday in a glass. Fantastic service and vibe. Worth the wait.
5/12/2020,4 star rating,Great for large groups and loads of sharing plates. Definitely something for everyone and a unique take on a lot of classic Indian dishes.
22/8/2018,5 star rating,Amazing Indian Fusion. Great food.  An expansive menu that is quite unique.  Great Service. Everyone from the greeters to the bartender to the hostesses were absolutely a pleasure to talk to and happy to give (very good) advice. Very long wait (we lined up outside for almost 2 hrs). I think it was well worth the experience.  Skipping Friday or Saturday night might be good to consider.  They don't take reservations after 6 pm.
2/11/2018,4 star rating,"It is so popular, before and after eating , there is always a long queue outside the restaurant. I would say the food is ok to try,but the environment is really good!"
18/6/2015,5 star rating,"A very nice experience of Indian food in London. This place gets my five star and no wonder why are they so busy. I went with my wife and my cousin and his wife. We were in the queue waiting for our turns and they served us either Indian tea or mint drink which in itself a great hospitality that they start thinking about their customers even before they dine in with the restaurant. We were seated after 40-45 mins of wait. We orders everything in the world from chicken tikka, seekh kabab, chicken biryani, daal makhani, bhaang lassi, naan etc etc. I will say each and every cuisine is authentic. Ambience is full of Bollywood theme, staff is extremely courteous and soft spoken. The food is of par excellence and what else do you want from a place that provides you with great eating experience for dinner? Your $ or £ won't go waste here. Worth trying if you are traveling to London or living here."
17/4/2019,5 star rating,"Fabulous- the Parsi Irani vibe is cool, it transports you to the OG irani hotels in Mumbai. I love this place, it's full of wonderful food and great service. Bravo Dishoom!"
17/6/2015,5 star rating,"I waited 2 hours in line on a Tuesday night to get into Dishoom for dinner, and I returned 14 hours later for breakfast. It was THAT good. If you're in London, DO NOT MISS DISHOOM. You WILL regret it. To any critics of London's food scene, I say: go to Dishoom because you're wrong. Lovely ambiance with marble tables and cute lighting, friendly servers, and an interesting mix of clientele. For dinner, my friend and I shared the okra fries, chicken ruby, Masala prawns, black house daal, garlic naan, and Roomala roti. Everything was EXCELLENT. We didn't manage to finish all of our food, but it was INCREDIBLE, and I was very sorry to leave food left over. We couldn't stop talking about it and had to return the next morning to try the legendary bacon naan roll. For breakfast, we split the bacon naan roll, sausage and egg naan roll, Bombay omelette, and we each ordered breakfast lassis. I actually liked the sausage and egg naan roll better than the bacon naan roll, but both were phenomenal and lived up to the hype. The Bombay omelette was average, but hey, there's not much you can do with an omelette. The breakfast lassis (yogurt, banana, and mango topped with oats) were AMAZING. I don't know what I can say about Dishoom that hasn't already been said on Yelp. Hands down my best food experience in London (if not the entirety of my Eurotrip). Do it. Worth the wait."
24/1/2020,5 star rating,"Great Indian restaurant in the heart of King's cross, whether you go with friends or colleagues, you are guaranteed a great time! I recommend the chicken ruby."
2/3/2018,3 star rating,"Average and overrated! Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe it's because we had breakfast but I didn't find this place particularly exciting. I'll most likely come back just as a follow up as I clearly must have missed something. But $7.50 USD for a piece of naan with bacon inside seems ridiculous. My fiancé ended up getting the Bombay omelette which was a little more filing and interesting but I was completely underwhelmed by the bacon naan wrap. I did observe other people get the bacon with egg which seems to give you a piece of naan that's twice of big. Looking back, perhaps I got the wrong item but the bacon naan is the suggested favorite on their menu. I will comment that their service was super on point though and that the atmosphere and decor were very nice and fitting."
1/1/2018,5 star rating,"I'd always heard that London had some of the world's best Indian cuisine, while Dishoom is listed by many as the go-to for anyone visiting the country. I can certainly see why, as the food was amazing. I wish I had gone in with a bigger appetite, because I would've loved to have tried 3 or 4 more menu items. I still get a bit emotional when thinking of how good the naan was. If you ever find yourself in London and looking for stellar Indian cuisine, I can't recommend Dishoom enough."
5/8/2016,4 star rating,When in London it goes without saying that having Indian food is de rigeur. I found Dishoom on Yelp and it is centrally located near Covent Gardens. The idea is a Bombay Cafe. The curries are good and flavourful and spicy. Kingfisher beer and good chai make for a very authentic and delicious meal
23/8/2019,5 star rating,"We loved the food, the atmosphere is great and the service was quite welcoming and friendly. A perfect break around a nice neighborhood walk"
14/10/2017,4 star rating,"First time eating at this place and at an Indian chain in general, so we didn't really know what to expect. Not bad, food was good but it was definitely overpriced. Our server was hard to find at some points. Four stars because of that and the prices."
11/7/2015,3 star rating,"Ahhh. What went wrong?? Where was my amazing Indian culinary experience? After weeks of hearing about how amazing Dishoom was, I finally made it to Covent Garden. After 30 minutes in line (6:30 pm on a Thursday), we got a table. Between the two of us, we shared the Paneer Tikka, Gunpowder potatoes, Black House Daal, Paneer roll, and Mahi Tikka. Unfortunately, none of the dishes stood out in terms of flavor profile. Good, but not memorable. I expected the dark and deep flavors of the Black House Daal to mesmerize me, but it was served room temperature and more porridge-y. The Mahi in the Mahi Tikka was tender, but didn't contrast with anything, let alone the yogurt it was served with. I did get a lot of the charred, smoky flavor in the Paneer Tikka, but then again that was it. The Gunpowder potatoes were also disappointing. I didn't get the aroma from seeds or herbs at all. I really really wanted to fall in love with this restaurant. I think it must be the hype as well as the way all the dishes are described on the menu that makes you have higher expectations. Dishoom was just ok. I wouldn't return for the price."
28/10/2019,5 star rating,"Absolutely delicious. We stood in line for about 45 minutes- we were through the queue doubled back and quoted that it would take up to 1 hour and a half. We were happy to wait since they handed out warm chai and sherry for the patient waiters. Ruby chicken, tiki chicken, pineapple paneer,and black daal were all delicious.  Definitely try the desert on a Stick! Every thing we had was delicious.  Our only small complaint was that the naan amount per order was small."
27/5/2018,5 star rating,"Cannot add much more than all the reviews ahead of me. Superb food. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Not a typical Indian restaurant per se'. In that you just dont order Tikka masala and call it a day. Its carefully flavored delicacies. Well priced, and quantity is good. We had the Mango laasi, lamb chops, Dishoom Tikka chicken, rice, naan, samosas and the corn. Chai tea to finish it off. Everything was perfect. Worth the wait. Try it."
19/7/2017,5 star rating,The wait was worth it and truly family friendly. We enjoyed all the food and best of all the specialty of the house. Black daal and naan. Go early !
11/12/2019,4 star rating,We heard such great reviews and the line was always an hour wait to get in so when we finally got to get in late one evening we were excited for the chance to experience the great food we heard about. It was OK but not great. Maybe because it was late the the kitchen have limited selection available.
17/7/2017,5 star rating,"Our dinner experience at Dishhoom was excellent.  The food was incredible!  We got some advice on amounts to order from our waiter, and we had a perfect amount. The only thing we regret is that we didn't have time to come back for brunch. We would absolutely recommend Dishoom to our friends, and would come again ourselves when in town."
4/10/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing! Love everything about this restaurant, from food, to decor, to service. It could not have been a better experience and the Yelp reviews were right on! Okra fries are a must. The Ruby's chicken is basically chicken tikka masala but a bit sweeter and creamier than most. The lamb is basically a vindaloo that was amazingly delicious. The kids portion was big as well. It is NOT a great place for vegetarians. And it's not great for the waistline I'm guessing. But you must go if in London!"
20/4/2017,5 star rating,"Absolutely incredible Indian food - likely some of the best my wife and I have ever had. Compared to other Indian restaurants, the food is more tomato-based (which to me is a huge plus). Everything was plenty flavorful and actually spicy when it says so! We over-ordered and attempted to stuff ourselves... The hour and a half wait was a bit silly, but we both agreed that we'd do it again!"
14/12/2017,5 star rating,"Really fantastic Indian restaurant. Before I came to London, 3 different people told me that I absolutely had to go to Dishoom, even if I took none of their other recommendations. The first time, I tried to make reservations on my birthday (a Sunday night in November) for myself and two friends, but I found out that they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. So we prepared ourselves for the long wait and got in the queue around 5:30. The staff was handing out chai and mint tea for those waiting outside. We were outside for around 45 minutes before getting led to the bar downstairs, where we waited for another 20 minutes. After that, our waitress led us upstairs and we were finally seated in the warm, beautifully decorated dining area. I ordered a cup of the house chai right away (the samples really work), and my friends ordered mango lassis, which were refreshingly light compared to other ones I've had. We then ordered a bunch of different dishes to share between the three of us: Vegetable samosas, cheese naan (takes naan to the next level -- try it!!), paneer tikka, chicken ruby, mattar paneer, black dahl, and gunpowder potatoes. It really was some of the best Indian food I've ever had. I think the black dahl was my favorite dish because I love lentils and it tasted the most unique. I don't eat meat, but the curry that came with the chicken ruby was fantastic. The chutneys that are served with the samosas are really wonderful -- ask for extra to eat with your rice. The service here is very, very good -- we had 2 different waiters checking in on us but we never felt rushed or annoyed. When I came with a different friend a Monday night, she ordered the Chicken Tikka thinking that it came with curry, but it was just the meat by itself. She asked if it was possible to get Chicken Tikka Masala instead -- and in under a minute, they'd replaced her dish without any hesitation. Everything about Dishoom is wonderful, from the food to the staff to the decor. I've never heard about anyone having a negative experience here. Whether you're in London for months, weeks, or days, definitely put this restaurant on your list."
15/8/2017,5 star rating,"I was blown away by their food. Everything was delicious (Chole Bhatura, Murgh Malai, Jackfruit Biriy) but my favorite thing was the House Black Daal. Besides that, the service was great. I would suggest making a reservation if you don't want to wait in line for an hour but, if you do decide to wait they serve you complimentary hot/cold drinks. They also allow you to sit at the bar for small snacks and drinks while you wait for a table. Overall, a great experience, no complaints, and I wish I lived closer to London!"
22/10/2019,5 star rating,"This was my favorite culinary experience in London. The service was out of this world, the ambiance it's amazing and the food was some of the best I've ever had!! 100% recommend!!"
9/6/2015,4 star rating,"Fantastic food, drinks and atmosphere. We arrived at 6pm on a Monday eve and had to wait 20 minutes for a table of 2, but it was a nice evening so fine to wait outside and the staff gave out the occasional glass of lemonade and chai tea to those in the queue. The only dampener on the meal was the supervisor on the basement floor. She came to our table 4 times to ask how our meal was going, so on top of being checked on by the waiting staff this was a bit of an over kill."
23/5/2015,5 star rating,"This one has been on my bookmarks list for a while. I admit it was there more for the prospect of a bacon naan. My wife had noticed it too and suggested we try it out for lunch on her birthday. While we didn't have a bacon naan, the decision was inspired and we had a lunch which surpassed our expectations. We chose several dishes which covered most parts of the menu. We ate until we had crossed the line marked ""full"" and we had no regrets. My favourite choice was the spicy lamb chops: great flavour, not overpowering, and as tender as you like. The black house daal was also well-liked. I ordered the house chai and later found out that I could have unlimited refills! For those who are on the edge of deciding whether to visit, that should push you over."
26/9/2017,5 star rating,"After waiting outside in the drizzling rain for close to an hour and grumbling about how the food BETTER be worth it, our party of 4 was seated on the upper level. The restaurant was absolutely packed but our waiter still took time to recommend and explain items on the menu. We ended up ordering a lot of food because we were ravenous after our wait. I don't know if it was because we had watched people eating through the windows while in line for so long or if the food was actually that good, but holy moly everything we ordered was delicious, flavorful, and made us forget our complaints about the wait! I'm sure you could close your eyes and point to any random dish on the menu, and it would be delicious. We ordered lamb biryani, chicken ruby, gunpowder potatoes, black daal, and garlic naan. It was almost too much to fit on our small table! The black daal really stood out to me. It was creamy, savory, and unlike anything I had tasted before. I think I fell in love with the black daal that day. I finally understand why Dishoom is so popular and successful. I would gladly wait two hours in line just to eat here again! The hype is very valid and you won't regret it."
3/6/2015,4 star rating,"I knew Dishoom was a must when my friend who lives in London said it was one of her favorites. We went to the one in Covent Garden, which wasn't far from our hotel. We got the garlic naan, fried okra fries, samosas, chicken tikka, lamb kabob, and chicken ruby. Everything was delicious. Yes, they come in smaller portions, but that's normal. My advice: Just order a lot and try it all. You won't walk away grumpy, I know that for sure."
6/6/2015,5 star rating,"Wife and I started our holiday in London last week and a friend recommended this place was worth a visit. I couldn't agree more. We both had no problem admitting this was the best food we had on the trip and the best indian food we've ever had!!! We had the ruby chicken and the vegetable samosas - both were so good. Also the dishoom IPA was a great beer - the best I've which was brewed exclusively for a restaurant.   If you're going to go, know there is usually a queue. We tried to go early around 5 and still had to wait around 30 minutes for a table of 2. While we were waiting, they came around twice with complimentary chai tea samples which was awesome! This is a place I will go out of my way to visit every time I'm in London. Exceptional service meets even better food and at a really good value - make sure you plan a visit!"
22/10/2017,5 star rating,"Back to the original location for the first time in 5+ years. I wouldn't even try getting in for a pre-theater dinner, but thankfully they accept breakfast reservations and they held ours even though we arrived just after the 15-minute window. Breakfast at Dishoom is always a pleasure, but until this meal, I thought it ended abruptly at 11:45 a.m., the last seating time for the meal. Not so, at least here on this day: They kept bringing us chai long after that time and after we'd finished our meals and settled in to read the papers. We finally, reluctantly got up to visit the nearby Portrait Gallery and National Gallery."
22/7/2017,5 star rating,"Lunch Starter Squid in batter Mains: Lamb chops Ruby chicken curry Naans Signatures Dhal Shrimp dish Food: except for squid starter everything else was delicious. Service: 4/5 Fast, on point. Be it by email or in person. Value: 4.5/5 Repeat: Yes! Reservations a must. Indian diner that attracts everyone from European kids hanging out with pals, to south asia's growing middle class touring London. Price, taste and service that appeals to all."
6/5/2018,5 star rating,"Wow. I love Indian food, but I just ruined it for myself. The only thing better than the food was the incredible service. I waited in line for an hour, which flew by as the staff brought me lemonade and continued to update me on my status. I finished my wait in the bar, where I had an amazing Viceroy Old Fashioned. I over-ordered intentionally so I could try a few things and take home leftovers. By far, my fave was the Chicken Ruby. I also loved the House Black Daal and mopped it all up with a delicious garlic naan. I must come back to try more. Worth the wait!"
17/10/2019,5 star rating,Amazing food! Probably best Indian food I ever had!!! Great customer service as well!
22/6/2019,5 star rating,"My dinner here might have been one of the top three meals in my entire life. That is no exaggeration. The dishes come family style and then you're able to share. My wife and I tried as many dishes as we could and ate everything! They have some really great drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic depending on your preferences. The service and ambience were also top class."
5/7/2018,5 star rating,"Never fails to surprise and delight. It doesn't matter how long the wait is. Dishoom runs a tight queuing operation! Lamb is always good, as is the chicken ruby. Love the black daal as well."
28/11/2017,4 star rating,"There's a long wait even with a booking to dine here but hey, its kinda worth it.  Really it's the upscale Indian place you want. Is there a better butter chicken elsewhere? Yes.  Is the paneer just as good and cheaper elsewhere? Likely.  Can you take it all and put it under one roof?  Well that's what Dishoom does.  The great quality across the board for a higher dollar price.  It's the way to go, no doubt."
24/1/2018,5 star rating,"LOVED EVERY BIT OF MY EXPERIENCE HERE. Just a couple of blocks away from where Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was showing, managed to eat here on my last night in London before going up to Scotland the next morn. It was a chilly November night and I waited outside in a short queue to get in. I think I waited about 30min but I heard it was worth it so I stayed. I know other reviews said that the staff came out with fresh hot chai to keep the guests warm as they wait but no chai that night. Finally inside lead to go downstairs by the bar area which I find really intimate and fun and dim. The downstairs also had a dining area versus the main floor. There at the bar, another 10-15min until they call you for the table. It was quick for me because I was dining solo. Ordered the usual mango lassi, chicken tikka masala, basmati rice, garlic naan and dessert. UFF. SO. GOOD. The staff were very attentive of me and other guests. Probably ended up spending 40 quids but I still love it! Everyone should gooo! I know I will the next time I'm in London!"
21/4/2019,5 star rating,"While in London we were in search of the best Indian food so that I could officially decide if I was an Indian food lover or not. WOWZER. This is a MUST try place! We went for dinner, but decided to come back for lunch to skip the 1.5 hour wait. Everything was spectacular. The only sad part is that they are only based in London and we are only based in the US and can't go on a regular basis. Don't hesitate on this place!"
29/11/2018,5 star rating,"The Kings Cross Branch unlike the others has amazing availability. As always the service is impeccable as I was seated immediately and was offered water right away. Staff were readily available to take your orders and explain the menu. Food is delicious - Bombay potatoes and biryanis was hot, spice and yummy the way I like it. Did I mention the establishment looks amazing! Am a returning customer."
8/7/2015,5 star rating,"A very nice Indian food in London, probably the best in my past year. The inner decorations are fashion and it is a good place to have either lunch or dinner. But you need to prepare that you will always need to wait in lines for a table for dinner, this restaurant is so popular lol try their coven garden special one and which is a curry soup comes with shrimp and white rice"
23/3/2017,4 star rating,"The food was solid. I had the okra fries, mahi tikka, and bowl of greens. Okra fries - split in half so more crispy edges. The batter was thin and nicely spiced. It went well with sauce trio they serve along with it. Mahi tikka - the fish was tender and flavorful. Squeeze of lime + fresh cilantro + the orange sauce of the trio = combined flavors for a really delicious bite. Bowl of greens - the flavors of chili and lime were absolutely delicious. The veggies were also not overcooked, so the broccoli, snap peas, and spinach all had a nice crunchy texture. Just wish it was a bit less oily. A quick comment to solo business travelers: We are not tourists, it's not a family vacation, so a lot of times we revert to solo dining at the bar. As a giant FYI, they still make you wait along with everyone else, which for me was brutal bc I'm battling a cough and we were standing outside in the cold. Thankfully there was hot tea served. Also, their bar is not conducive to dining - only drinks and finger food. As a result, I am sitting at a table that seems to have been set up as an afterthought in the rear corner of the downstairs dining area. Fine by me, just less ideal that the social, energetic experience of sitting at the bar. Chicken Tikka Masala is UK's national cuisine, so naturally I opted to try the nearest top rated restaurant for this dish. Overall, delicious. Just wasn't too thrilled with the host process."
13/12/2017,5 star rating,"This place 100% lives up to its expectations! As soon as I told friends I was going to London, every single person told me I must visit Dishoom. Luckily, I have a friend who lives in the area and she made a reservation for us as soon as she found out I was visiting! We ended up getting to the restaurant about half an hour before our reservation and just thought we'd check in to see if our table is ready. They directed us to the bar while they got our table ready. It was only about 10-15 minute later that we were seated at our table. Service was out of this world from the very moment we walked in! We ordered the chicken tikka, paneer tikka, black daal, pau bhaji, gunpowder potatoes, chilli cheese toast, jackfruit biryani, raita, garlic naan, and rumali roti. All for only 3 people - we just couldn't resist! Everything was so delicious - I don't think I could pick a favorite. I will say though that I'm not really a fan of daal, but their black daal was pretty delicious - even to me. Something that I wasn't really expecting to like, but loved was the jackfruit biryani. I've never had it before, or really any dish with jackfruit in it so I wasn't sure what to expect. It turned out to be what I probably ate the most of! I highly recommend trying it. TIP: MAKE A RESERVATION! I walked by the restaurant a few times during my trip and every single time there was a looooong line outside. I would have hated to be one of those people waiting in the cold. If you like Indian food and you're going to be in London, you're going to want to go here - just go ahead and make the reservation. :)"
12/1/2018,5 star rating,"What a meal!  Plate sharing indian food at its finest! I took my parents and siblings here, many of who do not normally eat indian food.  With my guidance, they all were blown away at how tasty (and not mouth burning) all the dishes were! Cocktails were also very well done. Waits seem to be very long here at times, so if you catch it with a short line go for it!"
3/12/2015,5 star rating,"One of three branches of this innovative and incredibly popular Indian eatery in London, Dishoom was a revelation, not least because it served breakfast like no other I've had, and gave me the chance to try for the first time a cup of spicy milky chai. Yum! It was also vegetarian friendly. Smart classy vibe in the dining room, jolly and helpful staff Dishoom offered a small but perfectly formed breakfast/brunch menu that features eggs or bacon in naan, Bombay omlette, spicy cheese toast and more. Whet your appetite by checking it out online.  If this is how they start the day I can't wait to try the dinner menu. Definitely one to put on the recommended list! Free wifi with no sign-in required. Look for 'ChaiFai""."
10/5/2015,4 star rating,"Having been to the Dishoom in King's Cross for lunch, I came to this one in Covent Garden for brunch a month later. While still great, I think the first experience was transcendental, so this one loses a star for not quite matching up. Good points: - It's a fun, attractive, interesting restaurant, with lots to catch the eye. - Food is good quality and tasty. - The chai tea is beautifully done. - The fire toast was simple but tasty. - It's very good value! The bacon naan was £5.20, I think. Less good points (note that these are all in comparison to King's Cross - so are me being picky rather than very unhappy): - The staff seemed very rushed and harried - we didn't really get a smile out of them and felt a little under pressure. The King's Cross branch had much friendlier staff. - I was a bit underwhelmed by my bacon and egg naan - I think my expectations had been built up too much. But in particular, I was annoyed that there were green onions cooked into my egg, because I hate them, and this wasn't on the menu. In addition, my egg wasn't runny. - It's not as interesting a space as King's Cross, despite the details. I'm DEFINITELY going back to Dishoom, but probably for lunch or dinner, and either trying out the Shoreditch one or going back to King's Cross."
7/4/2019,5 star rating,"Make a reservation because this place lives up to the hype.  The atmosphere is lively and fun.  Servers walk you through a ton of things to try without upselling and as we were there around 2 pm on a weekday, I would say it's busy ALL THE TIME. We tried the lamb samosas, house black daal, masala prawns, Dishoom chicken tikka and it was hands down the best Indian food I've ever had (I've lived in SF and LA . . . while not known for Indian food, still foodie cities).   I dream of going back."
10/3/2017,5 star rating,"Yelp peeps, yes!  You were spot on about this joint. Thank you! Upon arrival we were informed of a 1h wait.  The queue winds around outside however heat lamps are provided but must be in close proximity to benefit.  The wait ultimately was less than 1h.  Woot! Under promise, over deliver! Two Dishoom employees, who seemed to be focused on our satisfaction, came by frequently to offer complimentary warm chai tea as we waited.  This was a delightful and much needed touch on a cold winter/spring night. The service all around was top notch and highly attentive. My main dish - Chicken Ruby- was incredible; so incredible I toyed with the idea of ordering another round (the overstuffed feeling was the only reason I didn't). The dish displayed a delicate balance of spice, tinge of sweetness, and tender, delicious chicken. The prawn dish was ok, the dipping sauce provided with the plate added the extra needed kick.  I wouldn't order this again if I were to return. The vegetable samosas were forgettable.  Seemed to taste like nothing but fried oil. Cheese Naan bread- yes! Ten times over yes!  I used the naan bread to mop up the Chicken Ruby however it's so good on its own too. Pro tip:  do not check nutrition facts of naan bread whilst eating said naan bread."
21/3/2017,5 star rating,"BEST INDIAN FOOD I EVER HAD!  Life changing. It was worth the wait even though I don't understand why they make it look like. A club line and you need to head to the bar first before being seated. Why can't you just wait for an open table if you don't want to go to the bar. Besides my disapproval of the seating process, the food was delicious. The black daal is supposed to be the house special but I thought it tasted like bean soup. However the chicken curry and the rice with lamb was amazing. The garlic naan was best naan I ever had and wished each serving was more than 2. Going to come back here before my trip ends."
23/5/2015,3 star rating,"Ok, I randomly picked this place because it has high reviews on both Yelp and Trip Advisor. But a lot of Indian restaurants have high ratings in London - so it truly was a random pick. This is why I was shocked that there was a line waiting out the door at 3 pm on a random Saturday!! It's all good though. We decided to wait and were seated within 30 minutes. Which was awesome. The staff was very friendly. I mean - VERY. I have nothing but positive things to say about the people working here. However, service was a bit slow. We showed up during a shift change and we kinda got lost in the shuffle with our waitress. But that being said, we took a while eating (one of the people dining with us has a condition that requires her to eat slowly) during a very busy time and not once did we feel rushed. But why 3 stars? Well - because honestly I truly don't understand the hype. Yes, the food was good - but it was nothing special beyond a regular Indian restaurant. I think there's a lot of hype about this place and I'm not really sure why. I hear they have an amazing breakfast and a few wonderful and unique dishes, so maybe that's what bumps the rating up to 4 or 5 stars? To me, it was a bit noisy and there were a few very odd dishes on the menu that don't scream ""Indian"" to me. Fried okra? But I guess it's all about what you're into. Everything we had was ""A-OK."" Yes, I'd go back. But personally, I'd rather go someplace less touristy and less noisy. Not good for groups. Not good for children. Not good for romantic dining (since you won't be able to hear your date over the loud 40's music). But a cool experience. Oh, and prices are pretty reasonable - even with all the hype. Order the chai! Dishes we ordered: Mahi-Mahi Tikka Chicken Briyani Vegetable Curry Black Dhaal Naan Vegetable Samosas"

16/2/2017,5 star rating,"I can't say anything everyone else hasn't said... GO CHECK IT OUT! The hype is absolutely worth it. We were quoted at about 1.5 hours, but were seated in half the time. While we were waiting they gave us delicious hot masala chai. Plus the free wi-fi kept us occupied. We were seated downstairs and the decor was awesome. Everything has such a great unique touch. For food, we had the chili cheese toast, gunpowder potatoes, ruby chicken, rice, naan, and roomali roti. It was the perfect amount of food for 2 people. The cheese toast and ruby chicken was phenomenal. Honestly some of the best indian food I've had in a while! We also got a bottle of wine.. everything was pretty decently priced for being in the heart of london and a fancy indian restaurant!"
10/1/2018,4 star rating,"4.5 stars. Walked up to the restaurant's queue around 6:25pm, ended up seated within 45 minutes (pretty good considering I was prepared to wait up to an hour and 20 min as the hostess had suggested). While you wait in line, another hostess will offer samples of the House Chai to ease up your hunger. I dined solo and was seated at a small table instead of the bar so I was able to relax a little more. The staff were wonderfully attentive, great service and my waiter made sure to keep an eye out for me whenever I needed something. Based on the Yelp reviews, I ordered the vegetable samosas, chicken ruby, and garlic naan, and everything was delicious! The chicken ruby was spicier than I expected (I tend to eat mild to low-medium spicy, this was a little further along the medium range imo), and in hindsight I should've ordered some rice to offset it a little. I also requested still water, but I guess this meant bottled water and so I was charged another £3 for this (oops...next time I'll be sure to say ""tap""). All in all, it's a pricier establishment but you won't be disappointed with the food at all. I may have to come back here to try other dishes before I leave London."
5/11/2018,5 star rating,"Lamb chops, masala, wings, samosas (lamb and veggie) and garlic naan......amazing! This restaurant was recommended to us by one of our close friends in the States. We arrived to the restaurant to find out it was an hour wait for a table for two. Sooooo worth the wait. Service and quality of food were impeccable. Highly recommend."
18/3/2018,5 star rating,"AMAZING!!!!! worth the wait. Their service is spotless. We were told we were going to wait 90 minutes, no reservations taken, and although we were hungry and cold, we waited. Their staff brought out chai tea for everyone in line which was very kind. We asked if we could wait at the bar and after about 30 minutes we were taken there and the drinks were delicious. We must have been there 20 minutes and were then called to our table. We ordered a few tapas style plates having been told we should order two each to share but it was too much food. You may want to start with one each or a few and then continue. The food is like no other Indian food I've had in Los Angeles, both home cooked and at a restaurant. It is so flavorful, rich and unique. Definitely worth a visit."
20/9/2015,5 star rating,"I love this restaurant! Been here 5 times now and everyone I bring here also ends up loving it  I have tried the lunch/dinner menu here and both the veg and non-veg dishes are delicious. My favourites being calamari, Lamb boti, ruby chicken and roomali roti. I've had the coke float once, but was not available on the last 2 occasions I have been here, so that's the only disappointing thing about my trip, which is not bad. The customer service is amazing. They always put the customer 1st, which I believe is also why you'll always see people queuing some time for a table. On this trip, I did not make a reservation and queued I think half an hour and I had the opportunity to try the free chai offered. It was so delicious!! I have already made a reservation to go for breakfast next month"
10/2/2015,5 star rating,"I want to tell the owners of Dishoom to open a branch in NYC and I'll gladly run it for them! We've been here 5 times over the course of two years and love the authentic, Bombay street food-style small plates done just right. 5 star dishes on the menu: -- Vegetarian (potato + peas filling) or the lamb kheema samosas - both are excellent and a safe bet. -- Okra Fries: crispy, savory, yummy. I dream of them. -- Keema Pau - mince lamb meat served with traditional bread called Pau- a little oily, but also spicy - the husband swears by it. -- Black House Daal: one of the best we've tried. Buttery and rich without being too overwhelmingly heavy to digest. (sample with white rice) 4 star dishes: --Pau Bhaji: potatoes, tomatoes and other veggies mashed beyond recognition in a red color mixture that is a little fiery, a little tangy. I swear by it. -- Prawn Kolidwada: tiny prawns deep fried beyond recognition - what's not to love about pepper shrimp? 3 star dishes: -- Chicken ruby: the eponymous chicken tikka masala rechristened by Dishoom. A little too tomato-y for my liking, wasn't blown away by it. There are better dishes on this menu. Desert: I love the mango kulfi here, it's beautifully flavored with cardomom and not too sweet. Service: Very friendly and efficient most of the times. Decor: This is my favorite part. Modeled on the lines of mostly-defunct Irani cafes in Bombay, India, Dishoom stays true to spirit, elevating the retro-vibe to a more upscale level. Expect to see quirky ads and vintage Indian Bollywood posters that are a blast from the past for patrons like us. Nostalgia done right! Even the restroom wash basins are modeled from the ones in India back in the 60s and 70s.   Tip: Get a reservation if you can. Otherwise expect to wait at least 25-30 minutes anytime of day or evening."
16/5/2016,5 star rating,"Unbelievable!!!  Gunpowder potatoes are incredible treat,  get two orders cause your going to want more.  The lamb shank (can't remember the official name) is so succulent, must have. Service was also incredible,  I saw some reviews with complaints about service we had no problems.  Our waitress was fun and outgoing.   You will wait in line,  we waited 1.5 hours but it was so worth it.  If you have the time available it is so worth the wait.  Just get some drinks and Somoza's from the bar."
9/9/2017,4 star rating,"A few friends who recently visited London had great things to say about Dishoom. Mainly, it being a local, swanky, fun, loud,  delicious time. So immediately after landing and putting the luggage away, this place came to mind for dinner. Awesome introduction to London. Technically, Dishoom is ""Indian food,"" but it's also a a neo-fusion of culture and taste. Auspiciously, everything on the menu is a good choice. The host may attempt to recommend you get three entrées a person--my girlfriend and I ordered plenty after getting two or three entrées (altogether, not each) with rice and naan. The food was so good!! Had we gotten another entrée or two, I definitely would've eaten it I would have fallen into a food coma immediately after. The music in the background is great, some sort of blend between 1920 jazz, and swanky dance music. The wait is generally 30 minutes to an hour, but you can generally find a spot at the bar to grab a drink while you wait. If you're starving there's also generally two or three snacks at the bar you can purchase. For example, my girlfriend and I ordered vegetable samosas. Soooo good! Crispy light crunchy on the outside, nice veggie-mush on the inside. Definitely not cheap, but not annoyingly expensive. I think the price is just right. Well, there are a few outliers that are more expensive. But the median price ranged from £9-15£. So, more than I would normally pay at a pub, but also a very nice dinner. Would definitely go again if I were to visit London. You can wear whatever you want to dinner, but I would generally go with smart-casual-- A reasonably nice shirt and a reasonably nice pair of jeans at least. The staff was wonderful. We got pushed out the door a little quickly but it was in a very polite way given we were literally the last customer of the night (we arrived about an hour before closing). So instead of, for example, being offered a dessert menu after the meal, we were brought the dessert menu and asked if we would like to close out now or after dessert. Or as we looked over the main entrée menu, the host would comment we only had about 10 minutes to choose ab order before for the kitchen would be interrupted from it's closing process. That was annoying. I kind of understood... but at the same time, we did arrive an hour before closing, not five minutes before closing. And empathy aside, we did spend a combined £40-£50 (including drinks). So as polite and eloquent as the host was,  the pressure (at the very least) did not add to the experience."
4/11/2019,5 star rating,"While my sister and I were on our first abroad trip by ourselves, we knew we wanted to experience the great food London had to offer. I have never tried Indian food before going to this restaurant, and i am so happy to say that i loved it. I highly recommend trying their ""Kemma Pau"" and ""Murgh Malai"". Also coming from someone with a severe nut allergy, I felt that the restaurant was accommodating and put me at ease."
15/4/2017,5 star rating,"Delicious! Everything ordered tasted fantastic, fresh and extremely flavorful. The servers worked as a team and anticipated our needs before requested. Worth the wait!"
4/4/2017,5 star rating,"Ok. This place was amazing. The flavors are outstanding. My wife and I had the chicken ruby with a side of basmati rice and roti bread. Best Indian food we've ever had. Ever. We also ordered the daal, which was very good (but less flavorful than we expected). The wait for dinner is normally very long, so we came for lunch on a Tuesday. No wait, but we were lucky! Do not miss your chance to eat here. Yum!!!!!!"
1/12/2015,5 star rating,"We had heard so much about Dishoom, from friends and colleagues and everyone asked us to try it when we told them we were visiting London. I was almost sure I would be let down because this was just too much hype, but boy Dishoom delivers. To start off, there is always a wait, we tried thrice, at three different times and there was a wait each time. We waited for about 30 minutes, the line moved quickly. We waited at the bar for 10 minutes and their cocktails are pretty amazing, we had the chili martini, pimms and an old fashioned and everything was great. A friend tried the sweet and salty nimbu soda (lemon soda) which was so authentic, just like the ones we used to have as kids and they even let us adjust the salt to sweet ratio! We ordered a lot of food and nothing disappointed. For starters we had chilli cheese toast, vada pau, bhel puri and paneer tikka. The paneer tikka and Vada pau were exceptionally good ! Chilli cheese toast is a childhood favorite so that was my personal favorite. For the main course we had the black dal, a couple of chicken biryanis and the Chana Batura, the dal and Batura were lip smacking good. Can't fault the food in this place, it's really tasty. We were too stuffed to the dessert or have coffee and chai. If only they were not so crowded all the time we would have had a few more meals here. I especially like the sound of their breakfast menu. Until next time Dishoom,it's time to open one in NYC !! The service was lovely. Attentive and very polite even though they were handling such huge crowds."
5/3/2017,4 star rating,"Not being a London local, I happened upon this place thanks to Yelp. I came in for lunch on a Sunday and somehow avoid the typically long queue that form outside. I did still have a wait of  about 7-10 minutes in the wind and light rain, but they serve warm chai outside. A few things stuck out for me. You feel like you are entering a 4-5 star hotel or exclusive night club in the way they handle you. There are 2 door people who are outfitted with headsets. They take your name, after which the next 5 people will address you by name in the restaurant. Once you get past the door people, there is a mini reception. They address your party by name and let you know that there is a bar downstairs where you can wait till your table is ready. When you get downstairs, another reception greets your party by name and shows you to the bar. At the bar, the bartender crafts cocktails for you, takes your credit card and hands you a proxy card to take with you to your table. The table was ready in 5 minutes, while we were still sipping our drinks. When we arrived at our table, the host took our proxy card, again addressing our party by name. The food was very good. The service throughout was immaculate. The prices were very reasonable. Another interesting bit -- all of the service staff were from Europe (e.g. Spain, etc...) -- not an Indian in site, but the food was clearly cooked by Indian hands. Would definitely come again."
22/3/2019,5 star rating,"Great food, great atmosphere and great location.  I go to Dishoom on every trip to London.  Food is always consistent and every item on the menu is great!"
7/8/2019,3 star rating,"Honestly kind of overrated. Didn't have lamb chops when we went, we had to settle for the shank which was quite gamey. They could be better. Was expecting Jamavar type food, but not so much."
27/2/2017,5 star rating,"I dragged my husband on the tube and up 6 blocks to stand in line in the rain and he wasn't feeling it. I told him the line would go fast. (Ha! I lied but hey, it was worth a shot.) They told us it would be 90 minutes. Doh! I stayed in the cold line and it was sprinkling at one point but I was not going to come all this way from SF to punk out now. They brought everyone in line a free sherry shot and it went by fast. 55 minutes later we were seated and couldn't decide what to have so we ordered the ruby chicken, chicken tikka, butter bhutta, rice, garlic naan, and a lentil something. Omg. It was so worth the wait. I'm glad we braved the weather. Lots of Gluten free options available."
4/12/2015,5 star rating,"The U.K. does a proper Indian. Bring a huge fan of Indian food, both the vegetarian buffet style you find in supermarkets at heavily Indian populated communities to the nouveau fusion (chicken tikka masala poutine whaaaaat?) American style, got to hand it to the Brits for what they do. This was one of our most delicious and memorable meals in London. Standouts Black daal Spicy lamb chops Good Ruby chicken Bowl of greens Tips We liked the garlic naan more than the roti Why is this restaurant so far away? It would definitely become part of the rotation."
29/1/2017,5 star rating,"Absolutely delicious! All the Indian food suspects kicked up a notch for today's modern tastes. The only complaint that I had was that I didn't have enough room in my stomach to eat everything. It's the kind of place where even the basic side dishes warrant some praise (e.g., bowl of greens). The service was really good and I appreciated that they didn't overseat even though it's clearly a popular place to eat. I'm sure that helps with the service and food for that matter. Expect a wait. We first tried to go in the evening, but it would have taken at least 2 hours. I don't care how good the food is supposed to be, but 2 hours is just too long for me to stand outside in the freezing cold. Yes, I might have been able to get inside and wait for your table earlier at the bar, but that still would have been a long time before that happened. We ended up going to lunch instead the following day and there was a 30 minute wait, with a 15-minute wait outside. Much better!"
20/8/2017,4 star rating,Really fashionable Indian restaurant. The decor in any of their restaurants is just beautiful. Food is really good. Breakfast is yummy and different from the typical scene in London. For lunch it is better when you are more than 2 people so you can order different plates between all of you to try  all of them! Don't forget to book or you will have to queue for a bit.
5/11/2017,5 star rating,I have been ruined for all other Indian food. This is a must eat type of place. Ask your waiter to help with offering- ours made some great suggestions and we loved it all.   We sat downstairs and I thought it was going to be a bit loud and crowded. Once I started eating that all slipped away and we were just focused on enjoying it all. I had an East Indian Gimlet with my meal - perfectly balanced the heat of the food. Had a chai tea - perfectly spiced and smooth - and a hot toddy with dessert - chocolate pudding with chili ice cream. It was all delicious.
28/11/2017,5 star rating,"One of my favorite restaurants in London. Excellent modern Indian food. We ordered a few different curries, daal and naan. Particularly like the Ruby chicken (rich creamy curry with tender chicken - a good alternative to the common Chicken tikka masala we had in the US) and garlic naan - great flavorful combo. Lively trendy atmosphere. We came early (right when it opened) and avoided the long line."
5/11/2015,3 star rating,"I know, I know. It's Londoners' official favourite restaurant and yet, only three stars from me? Who do I think I am to contest the opinion of the masses eh? Well, to be honest, I just didn't find the food to be quite up to speed. The cocktails were fabulous, and so is the decoration (those mirrors!!), the staff was lovely and pudding was quite wonderful, but the rest could simply have been better. It was mainly lacking the balance and complexity of flavour I was expecting from such a high reputation restaurant. ... So as far as I'm concerned, the quest for London's best Indian restaurant is still on! (I still have to try Dishoom's breakfast, which I've only heard good things about though... i'll keep you posted)"
17/5/2015,5 star rating,"If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Don't even know where to begin. Bottom line: DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE. Unanimously voted worth waiting outside in line for an hour in the cold (sweetened by cups of chai and lemonade on the house - but don't worry, you can reserve tables too). Gimlet was the best I ever had. Bombay colada was fresh and heavenly. Calamari, black daal, and garlic naan were phenomenal. Also had chicken tikka and lamb biryani that were amazing. Our only regret was not ordering a side of basmati rice to spoon the remaining black daal and tikka sauce over. Service was very fast and attentive. Prices extremely reasonable. The decor. Don't even get me started! Modern chic brasserie with awesome vintage Indian film posters and pictures/ads. Cool lighting and fans spinning above head. Feels like a jump back to a modernized, chic, Bombay British colonial place."
23/6/2018,5 star rating,"All the good reviews and we needed to try this place. If you use Yelp to search for good Indian food in London by ratings, the top five Indian restaurants that show up are Dishoom. While it's a small chain - the food is definitely is not chain like. They told us that the wait will be an hour and 15min. We almost decided to leave but we were only in London for a days and a half so we waited it out in the bar. If you have to wait get the Dal Moth - this little snack is so very tasty. The atmosphere is very lively, and the staff super friendly. They even have a small kids meal menu. Turns out the wait was only 40min but even at 1hr and 15min it would still be worth the wait. The best dish we had was the Black Dal - it's their signature dish. It's cooked for 24hours and it's basically Dal with a light smoky taste. Very yummy :) In all we had some samosas, four different curries and the chicken berry biryani - got a side or rice and some rita. That was plenty for a party of four. If you have to have great Indian food, I would highly recommend Dishoom as a place to go. Pick the one on Kingly Street just a short 15min walk from Piccadilly Square. The neighborhood for this restaurant is very fun."
24/10/2017,5 star rating,"Amazing food. I was about to throw the towel in about legendary Indian food in London but good thing we stopped by. Had the Ruby chicken, paneer tikka, roti, garlic Nan, gunpowder potatoes and chole bhathura. Everything was pretty amazing. I personally like chewy bread and the nan was pretty chrispy but still good. I preferred the roti. Paneer tikka and chicken was amazing. The portions are absolutely perfect and my wife and I were completely stuffed and couldn't finish our meal. For dessert we tried the Kulfi and it was creamy and still good. We'll probably come back tomorrow. This is hands down the best Indian restaurant in London. I wasn't a huge fan of the other three we tried here"
16/4/2017,5 star rating,"Some of the best Indian I've had. Delicious naan! Not a lot of curries to choose from, but the chicken ruby was delicious! Came for lunch around 13 and ""only"" had to wait 15-ish minutes - definitely worth it. But make sure to book in advance for evening dinners."
2/8/2017,3 star rating,"We went here for breakfast and it was not a pleasant experience. Some food was good; the naan rolls were delicious. The restaurant has quality food suppliers. Some were disastrous. The mushrooms were way overcooked. It became completely inedible and tasted like charcoal. Mostly, the waiter completely forgot to bring my main dish. I waited for more than half an hour and cannot even find my waiter. I was starving to begin with and I was feeling a bit pissed after a sustained duration of starvation and the inedible mushroom. After I explained the situation to the head of the wait staff, they brought my egg and bacon roll out finally. And the management apologized and offered this meal free on the house. So I appreciated that."
25/1/2018,5 star rating,"Be prepared for a terribly long wait! We waited about 1.5 on a Saturday night to try this gem out. As visitors in London, we had to experience this popular place for ourselves and I wouldn't say I regret it at all. Best Indian/Pakistani cuisine in London hands-down. Food was delicious-perfectly seasoned, fresh and authentic. We got the ""recommended popular"" dishes- if it is your first time I'd go with their recs too. Chicken Ruby, Garlic Naan, Spicy Lamb Chops and a beef/goat curry (forgot the name but ask them for the popular curry dish). All the items were exceptional and satisfying. Get these items and thank me later! Definitely worth the wait and the calories, in my opinion."
17/10/2017,5 star rating,"I'm really beginning to appreciate Indian cuisine. So many travelers rave about how spectacular Indian food is in London, compared to traditional ""bland"" (so they say) English food. I knew I had some research to do, because I only look for the best. With that said, Dishoom was the spot that was recommended the most. So, I get there after struggling trying to find the place. There's an intimidating line outside the door, the guy tells me it will be an hour wait. It actually took about 45 min. Good thing about the wait in line, is that they serve you delicious Chai tea. Any way, I get in and order the highly recommended, ""Ruby Chicken"" (their version of Tikka Marsala), Chicken Biryani, and a Naan with melted cheddar insided (if you're from Mexico or the U.S., no need to get this, it was good, but it's practically a quesadilla...been there, done that). Every thing was so tasty even down to the 3 sauces that accompany every meal (chutney, tamarind, and some green sauce). The staff was very nice, and the ambiance of the restaurant was nice as well...I sat downstairs. My advice...try it!"
19/7/2019,5 star rating,"Get the Black Dahl with roomali roti. Full stop. Just do it! The mojito was also very refreshing with coconut flakes on top. My party had a 1.5 hr wait, it was worth it! The chai is top notch, served for free while you wait (and is better than most places where you have to pay for it!)"
2/1/2017,3 star rating,"Dishoom is solid, but certainly overhyped. Make sure you have a reservation, or be prepared for a very long wait. The interior was great, unique touches and fun elements from India, and the service was also excellent. The food itself was good, middle of the road. Overall, good, but over hyped. Great interior and service. Naan bacon roll was tasty but nothing too special, same for the paneer tikka. I'll be back to try a few more dishes, and the ambiance and concept are nice enough that this place warrants multiple visits."
29/3/2017,4 star rating,"Excellent food! The service is quick but the wait in line is nearly 1.5 hours on a busy evening. We stopped by our 1 day in London because it was close to where we were staying in Mayfair. We waited for about 1.5 hours to be seated, but they did bring us chai and tea while we were in line to keep us occupied. Seating inside is cramped if you don't get a booth. The decor is very well done. The portions are smaller then what you get stateside so be prepared to order more then you think you will need. Also, definitely get the gulfi at the end! It was delicious."

11/8/2015,5 star rating,"Worth the wait, have the house black daal. Very trendy and yet amazing food. The ambiance is awesome, the service was on point and the food fantastic. Mind you you will wait at the door for a table but you'll soon know why"
29/1/2019,5 star rating,LOVE coming here. I hate that there's always a wait but it's definitely worth waiting for. I've almost had everything on the menu and have not ever been disappointed. I suggest ordering lots of different dishes and sharing. I absolutely LOVE the cheese naan and it is a must when coming. They can definitely accommodate large parties and if you're 6 or more I believe you can make reservations which I would highly suggest. Everything is also reasonably priced. I usually come as a party of 3 or 4 and we tend to order at least 4-5 dishes each time.
6/10/2019,5 star rating,Excellent food and service. This is as good as it gets! Everything was delicious and the staff was very welcoming. The only downside was the wait but well worth it .
11/6/2019,5 star rating,"I can't say enough about how AMAZING this restaurant is. On our eight day visit, we ate there twice! It is worth the two 90 minute wait periods we had, both occasions. We enjoyed the gun powder potatoes, delicious. The chili cheese toast, delicious. The shrimp masala, to die for.  Our second visit was my husbands birthday, I shared that with our server as we ordered our meal. Several minutes later there were about eight servers singing happy birthday to him with a candle in his chili cheese toast (the very reason we went back twice). It was precious and priceless. The decor is London cool and the service, topnotch. The food is out of this world. We live in the states and will now never enjoy Indian food the same way. I highly recommend you enjoy Dishoom when you are next in London!"
11/6/2019,5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing Indian food. We went to the one in Kingsley's Court and found the food, service, and atmosphere more than fantastic. We enjoyed lamb with a curry sauce, Naan bread, and a fried chicken appetizer. For dessert, we indulged in a chocolate pudding topped with chili ice cream. Dishoom went above and beyond my expectation and I cannot wait to return to taste across the expansive menu."
5/1/2015,4 star rating,"Dishoom is a tribute to Hindi movies made in the Mumbai (Bombay) film industry also known as Bollywood. Dishoom is actually the sound effect one heard during the fight scenes in old Bollywood films when the good 'uns and the baddies used to punch each other to oblivion (or until the very competent police finally arrived). We were booked at Dishoom for NYE dinner by my wife's uncle and aunt. We were told that on any other day you need to queue up (even upto 45 minutes), just to get in and then you wait again to be seated at a table (another 45 minutes, possibly). Given the occasion, there was a set menu, one each for vegetarians and meat eaters. The menu I've uploaded is the meat one. On arrival we were given a glass of complementary prosecco each. Starters were based on traditional Bombay street food. We had pav bhaji (spicy-tangy potato based curry  with buns), the meat version with mince lamb, paneer tikka, fried okras and grilled prawns. The mains consisted of chicken biryani, vegetable biryani as the rice dishes. These appeared to be dum biryanis. The dum pukht method of cooking biryanis is one in which the rice and meat/vegetable are layered with each other in a pot and slow cooked. Before cooking, however, the pot is tightly sealed in order to retain the aromas. In addition to the biryanis, we also had naan breads and rumali rotis. Rumal, in hindi means a very thin handkerchief. Rumali rotis are made that thin and it takes a lot of skill to make these by hand. We also had dal makhanis (black gram cooked in a creamy sauce) and malai koftas (deep fried vegetable-cheese balls in a creamy sauce). Oh, before I forget, we also had tandoori grilled lamb on the bone. All the mains were very, very well prepared and presented, but the chicken biryani, I felt lacked that spicy grunt, which one expects in a dum biryani. For dessert we had what they called a Gujju chocolate mousse. Gujju is the friendly slag term we Indians use for Gujaratis, who, by the way make some amazing sweets and desserts. The mousse, however was a big disappointment as it didn't feel very gujju. We also had masala chai (traditional north indian tea with ginger, cardamom and spices, with a hint of sugar). The chai was fantastic! I am allergic to things that swim. Fish, prawns, mussels, shell fish, you name it. Since some of the dishes on the meat menu were fish based the restaurant offered me a veggie menu and very kindly told me they won't charge extra for any meat dishes I may want to order from the set menu, especially given that the set menu was priced around £50 per person. This, I felt was a great gesture on their part. However only 4 stars this time as the chicken biryani did not feel up to scratch and the chocolate mousse didn't feel very Gujju at all. I enjoyed the experience of dining at Dishoom and thoroughly recommend it. As with everywhere else, I hope they maintain their quality of cooking and levels of service."
9/7/2019,5 star rating,"Excellent Indian. Every dish was unique and fresh. The roti was outstanding and samosas are crispy pockets of deliciousness.  Everything we had was very good and had its own individual taste. Sometimes all the dishes can taste the same but not at Dishoom, you can tell your food is made to order."
1/3/2018,5 star rating,"Creative, cultural dishes that make me want to return until I can try everything on the menu. I am both impressed and appreciative. They sat a group of 6 on a busy lunch without a wait. We ordered lots of food, chai tea, and starters that, even with 6 people, had split/individual checks. Would recommend to all friends visiting London."
20/5/2017,5 star rating,"Came here for lunch and Dishoom did not disappoint. It was the best meal I had while staying in London. I ordered the Spicy Lamb Chops, Chicken Ruby, Black House Daal, Garlic Naan, and Jasmine Rice. Everything I ordered, I would order again upon returning to this restaurant. I definitely recommend ordering a variety of dishes from the menu. Also their traditional Chai is a must-order -- they're bottomless until 5PM!"
6/7/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing food.  We had the potatos, paneer and pineapple the Kheer all our of this world !  Would definitely recommend"
11/8/2019,5 star rating,"Doesn't take reservations and we were told an hour wait but to come back early to check back.  Pager was limited in range so when we came back 40 minutes later they said they had been ready for us and we would have to wait another 10 or so minutes, still less than the 1 hour we were first told.  After this initial hiccup we settled in.  Wait staff made suggestions which we pretty much went with.  Chicken soup, daal, jackfruit biryani, lamb chops were all exceptional.  Staff was attentive and made sure the whole party including children were attended to.  A few small items were missed but the overall food was exceptional making these shortcomings relatively minimal."
5/7/2019,5 star rating,"This place was incredible. I arrived a tad late for my reservation but they still managed to seat me within 20 minutes. My servers we're knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. The food was superb and made my vegetarian heart happy. The Pau Bhaji was bursting with flavor and the black daal was smooth and delicious with the naan bread. I left a very happy customer."

27/4/2015,5 star rating,"This joint serves up very delicious Indian food. I normally don't hunt down Indian food, but since I was in London visiting I had to have some. Out of all the meals I had during my week stay, this was the best meal I had. The Chicken Ruby, their version of Chicken Tiki Masala, was very tasty. It had a great balance of richness and the chicken was very moist and tender. My favorite by far was the cheesy naan. It was like a naan quesadilla. So good. The atmosphere is great, buzzing with guests. The portions are perfect for sharing. Make sure you leave yourself time to wait in the que because it is a popular spot, but worth the wait."
10/12/2014,5 star rating,"Dishoom was a great experience for dinner for my wife and I. We practically LOVED everything that was served to us!! We were lucky enough that we arrived and the wait for 2 was not that long.  We wanted to have Indian the night before, but we were a party of 9 and when we got there, there was a line that spun around the front windows.  So we opted out that evening.  So glad that we made it back. The cocktails were expertly crafted and perfectly blended.  The bartenders downstairs struck up a convo and asked what were we looking for to satisfy our palate and sip on while we waited for our table.  The drinks were excellent and definitely went well with dinner also. The Black Daal- I believe this was the special, but it had a wonderful taste.  The black lentils were simmered and seasoned extremely well.  You can taste every spice blended into the daal.   Kacchi Lamb- This rice dice is enough for one and will satisfy your hunger.  But why order one when you can order many.  Large chunks of tender lamb meat, tasted very good, spiced well, and layered with rice on top.  Very well executed. Lamb Boti Kabab-  Tender pieces of lamb, grilled, garlicky and gingery, but not overwhelming.  Served with a couple of wedges of limes that when topped, it definitely brought out the taste of the meat.  It was so well seasoned that even in the center of the bite, you can taste the seasonings. Chicken Ruby- Tasty curry with dark meat chicken, slight sweetness to it that went well as a dipper for the naan.  Or I mean...the soaker...Soaked up all the goodness with the naan. Raita- The yogurt sauce was served plentiful.  Good consistency and a good balance for every plate. Naan- Warm, chewy and great for dipping! Can't say enough good things about Dishoom.  It definitely enhances every aspect of your mouth and it was so delicious, we practically cleaned up every plate with the last piece of naan.  Wish there was a Dishoom back at home...I'd be a frequent flyer."
27/4/2017,3 star rating,"We didn't love this.  The space was a bit overwhelming, the food was OK, and the drinks were too sweet.  It seemed like a restaurant that received way too much hype and couldn't maintain their quality.  The service was also just bad; our waitress basically ignored us and we didn't receive our bill until almost an hour after requesting it.  The only standout item was the ruby chicken, but I would go to a traditional Indian restaurant for everything else."
15/2/2018,4 star rating,After waiting in line for an hour we finally got in. Fusion Indian ambience. The menu offers mostly Indian street food with some exceptions. The food was good not great. Slightly overhyped in my opinion. Decent overall.
1/7/2019,5 star rating,This Indian place is the best in London. I loved it.  it was my first time in London and my first time at this Indian food place. it was awesome. The managers and their waiters gave us great service. Food was delicious. I will highly recommend this place!!.
30/11/2016,5 star rating,"Food:  From the top of my head, my wife and I ordered the naan, the chicken ruby, prawns, and samosas.  The chicken ruby was very good.  Most of the food we tried were pretty good. Food rating:  5/5 Service:  We waiting almost an hour outside in the cold, but the nice thing was the free chai and (I forgot the alcoholic) they gave out to their freezing customers!  That was a nice touch to it.  Service here is pretty standard. Service rating:  4/5 Price:  Expect to pay about $13 per small entree.  Portions are small but I believe they are meant to be shared. Overall:  The was the best food I tried in London, only complaint is that the lines were way too long.  The price you pay for good food."
5/8/2019,5 star rating,"The best Indian restaurant I've ever been to! We waited 45 minutes for a table because it was so busy. However, it was well worth the wait and they brought us hot cups of chai as we waited outside which was a nice touch. My favorite dish was the chicken curry which was amazing!"
10/5/2017,1 star rating,"Don't waste your money. Service was average and we went at non-peak hours with very few other tables there. The food was incredibly underwhelming, very inauthentic. There were very little spices and nothing tasted like the many Indian restaurants I have enjoyed in the past. Of the many dishes we ordered, not one of them was memorable. The portions are tiny, and the prices are pretty ridiculous in my opinion (we paid about 35£/person and we're all very hungry after). If you are looking for real Indian food, skip Dishoom. Dishoom doesn't have the ambiance, tastes, smells, or service that its prices reflect or of a quality Indian restaurant. Pass on Dishoom, London has excellent Indian food elsewhere for half the price that is far better and more filling. TLDR; expensive, bland dishes, small portions, average service."
25/10/2016,4 star rating,"The name Dishoom is the Indian movie equivalent of KAPOW! in superhero comics - the amplified sound (particularly in movies of 70s and 80s) when the fist of the hero connected with the face of the villain. Not sure who the villain is in this case, but the restaurant has certainly connected with the public, and now has five locations. Students of business broadly, and positioning in particular, should find Dishoom as a fascinating case study. Not simply for creating demand that no one knew existed (the Brits are unlikely to tire of the Curry House format anytime soon), but for educating and convincing people that their lives had been incomplete without it! Dishoom is more than the sum of its parts. Yes, it is a very competent and affordable restaurant for lunch and dinner, but it is also one which explicitly positioned itself as a breakfast destination, as opposed to treating it as an afterthought to cover the costs for premises. For those who don't know, this was done by intelligently leveraging human nostalgia for the past and modeling their (scalable) business after the Irani cafes in Bombay (now Mumbai) popular in the Twentieth century, but whose numbers have dwindled considerably in the last decades. As background, Irani cafes were all day cafes inspired by the European coffee houses, and were places where people from all stratas of life could lounge all day, should they so choose, engaging in activities as diverse from reading the newspaper, writing their literary masterpiece, or just taking a break from the humdrum of the office. In my minds' eye, I can visualize a room large enough to be a banquet hall, decorated with family portraits, ceiling fans blowing air to provide patrons respite from the hot and humid summer day... so you can see, you can cut the romanticism with a knife. But, here's the anomaly: the people who're seated here are basically foodies (pardon the word usage) and Indians, not necessarily mutually exclusive, with almost no one who would remember personally going to the cafes in now Mumbai. Nor would anyone confuse the patrons here for Bob Dylan (hey, he's a Nobel Prize winner now!).  Despite the meticulous set design, there's no slice of old Bombay here - but that's the magic of the positioning, as opposed to serious culinary chops, that no one pays any attention to that. Enough backdrop, the food is good (at times: excellent), but uneven with lots of misses in my 3 visits. My favorite menu items from the all day menu include the Masala Prawns, the spicy lamb chops, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and Keema Pau (popular menu item at the Irani cafes).  For breakfast, I've liked the Kejriwal (fried eggs on chilli cheese toast) and Keema Per Eedu (chicken keema, chicken liver, fried eggs, and crisp chips). When it comes to drinks, they have quite a few innovative ones on their menu, e.g. Bhang Lassi (with/without rum) with ginger, almond syrup, yogurt, fennel sprinkles. The one I liked more was the Mango and Fennel Lassi. But, I've yet to like any dessert here, particularly iced things whether in a glass (gola ice) or a stick (kulfi). While I was tempted, I decided not to try the cream, meringue and strawberries dessert (Memsahib's mess). I saw it at a neighboring table and it certainly looked heavy enough to knock one out with a solid Dishoom..."
23/1/2017,4 star rating,"What I Ordered: Ruby Chicken, Grilled Paneer, Spicy Slaw, Garlic Naan and Cheese Naan Flavor: Everything tasted very good.  Not the best Indian I've ever had but definitely up there. Service:  They take great care of you here. We were waiting in the cold outside in line to get in, and the hostess would serve us warm tea while we wait.  The wait time, while long, didn't take longer than they had estimated. The one annoying thing about the service is this one of those places where the server feels the need to ""explain the menu"" to you, which came off like a cheap sales pitch to get us to order pricey appetizers. Atmosphere: Very trendy.  This ain't your mama's Indian restaurant.  Great decor inside. Price: Very reasonable for the quality you get. Location: Close to Covent Garden, so pretty convenient for tourists. Other Comments:  This is NOT a traditional Indian restaurant with a traditional menu.  They really only have a couple meat curries on the menu and everything else is some sort of creation that has to be exclusive to Dishoom.  It's a nice change of pace if you want to try something new."
24/5/2017,5 star rating,"Came in on a Monday around 5 pm without reservations and it only took bout 25 minutes to get seated. The staff here all go above and beyond and I'd say this was my favorite restaurant to eat at in London. They bring out some tea while you wait in line outside, then take you downstairs to the bar to wait for your table. Once a table is open someone comes down to the bar to bring you back up and get you seated. The food is absolutely delicious. After eating ""traditional food"" for two days I would've killed to have something with spice on it and this place delivered. I'm sure everyone's covered how good the food is compared to what else is available in the city. So aside from that I just want to say the staff here is absolutely awesome. It was a great experience and I'd happily come back."
22/6/2019,5 star rating,"Best Indian food in London! The wait might be long if you show up after 5, but worth it! They will even bring you tea outside while you wait:) nothing good comes easy, and if there's a line it's worth the wait."
15/7/2018,5 star rating,Absolutely lovely Indian food!!!  Fantastic service and great ambiance!!!!  We enjoyed every dish we were served!!  Highly recommend chicken ruby!!!  Naan bread was to die for!!!  Definitely give this place a try!  You will love it!
11/4/2018,4 star rating,"In Carnaby, off Oxford st. Can't go wrong eating at Dishoom. Hot spot for locals and tourists alike. We went on a Tuesday around 6pm, waiting an hour or so for a table, had a drink in their bar while waiting. Cool decor. The veggie samosas were delicious. Cheese paneer sooo good. Garlic and cheese Naan, tasty! Would def return."
2/12/2014,3 star rating,"After multiple friends recommended Dishoom to me as the best Indian restaurant in all of London... I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. I expected to have my mind completely blown, never to be satisfied by the masses of mediocre Indian fare again. Suffice it to say that my expectations were a wee bit too high. Although even the cabbies said that London has the best Indian food in all the world - better even than India herself... meh. I've honestly had better. The menu is definitely interesting with some fusion and inventive options. I think I would've liked more flavor though in all the dishes I had there.   I bumped off a star for being underwhelmed, but still a great meal can be had here."
20/5/2019,2 star rating,"Way too overrated. Had the chilli chicken (best dish ordered), lamb kebab (texture of beef liver), ruby red chicken (sweet), garlic naan (nothing special, too thin). We got there at 11:20 am on a Monday so we had drinks while waiting for the noon hour to order lunch. If we had to wait one minute (much less 2 hrs) for a seat I would've been terribly disappointed. Go for the experience if no wait, otherwise don't bother."
15/12/2014,5 star rating,"I had my first trip to Dishoom last week after hearing numerous glowing reviews and, I have to say, I was totally blown away. The whole experience was fantastic. Excellent service (despite it being the pre theatre crush) and wonderful food made it a memorable trip. Everything that we ate was delicious but the Black Daal, one of the house specials, was a rich and sumptuous delight that really stood out. The Pau Bhaji is also highly recommended. The quality of the food means that I am keen to get back to London asap to continue exploring the menu."
28/1/2017,5 star rating,"Dishoom is the most incredible Indian food I have ever had in my life. We waited about two hours for the meal but it was 200% worth it. I would recommend this place to anyone living in or visiting London. The ruby chicken, vegetable biriani, side of greens, Dahl, shrimp, and chickpeas are all so great. The okra fries are the best I have had. The food is so flavorful and for the amount of food you get it is very reasonably priced. Amazing food- can't edit to go back"
12/10/2019,5 star rating,If you like Indian food and you are in London then you should try Dishoom... don't forget Indian old fashion drink! Usually you have to wait in alone though
9/8/2015,5 star rating,"Dishoom was definitely one of the most delicious highlights of our trip to London. Did I say delicious? The ambiance, energy and service were all great We over-ordered so we could try a bit of everything -Dal, Chicken Tikka, Chicken Ruby, Mango Salad, Veggie Samosa. Everything but the samosa was exemplary. The samosa was just OK but we couldn't really complain. The lime-soaked Chicken Ruby was very very very good. We've been home two weeks and we're still talking about it. Hoping Dishoom will look to expand to NY. When the day comes, we'll be there!"
7/9/2019,5 star rating,Well worth the wait...they handed out free Sherry to keep us warm in the line!!!  The food incredible and the drinks are amazing!!!
28/3/2016,4 star rating,"I had heard great things about Dishoom, and made up my mind to visit the next time I was in London! My first attempt was on a Sunday at 2PM, and even then was told that the wait would be 1.5 hours!! I decided I would put my name down, but then was super confused when the greeters immediately ushered me downstairs and to the bar -- apparently, you have to wait for your spot either at the bar or right outside the restaurant aka I couldn't go and shop or do anything while I waited.... No thank you! I tried again the next day around 12:30PM for lunch and this time was pleasantly surprised when I immediately got a table (I was eating alone so that's probably part of the reason!). I usually don't mind eating alone but this time felt really uncomfortable for the first 8-10 minutes when I was clearly waiting to order but none of the 5 waiters in the area bothered stopping by. Eventually I got the waitress' attention and she suggested that I try the chicken ruby (aka butter chicken) with garlic naan, which is exactly what I did! The garlic naan was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! Just the right amount of crispy, still soft, and the garlic flavor was perfect. The chicken was spicy (which I love) but wasn't as fantastic as I had hoped -- I wish it were a bit creamier, but the meat was sumptuous and overall quite a good meal. One thing to note: for a 5'4"" girl, the food portions were perfect! However, it can be a bit pricy for the amount that you get, especially the chai latte which was microscopic! Still delicious, just a heads up to order more naan or another dish if you're very hungry!!"
14/5/2019,5 star rating,Absolutely fantastic experience from start to finish. The garlic naan was delicious and the chicken Ruby is the best curry I've ever had. The dessert of chocolate pudding with chili ice cream was delectable.
21/7/2019,5 star rating,"Just aweome food. The shrimp appetizer, lamb chops, rumali roti and chicken tikka masala was just awesome."
22/12/2016,3 star rating,"London is known for having the best Indian food after the country India itself. When I visited London, I was with an Indian food fanatic who insisted on eating it as often as possible. After hearing about Dishoom and the wonderful reputation it had, we knew we had to visit. Since Dishoom is so popular, it's well known that you're going to encounter a long line when you arrive. We had read reviews of people waiting up to 2 hours. My sister and I came prepared for the long haul. We weren't going to leave, no matter what. Luckily for us, we waited outside for about 45min (thankfully since it was pretty cold outside). We thought we had finally made it in, but then we were directed to a bar on the bottom floor to wait longer at a bar. I'm guessing Dishoom does this to get you out of the cold, and get some drinks in your system while you wait. We were called to our table about 15 minutes later. My first impression of Dishoom was how busy it was. The restaurant is loud and filled with voices of people having a good time. Every seat was taken and the restaurant worked like a machine getting people in, feed, and out again. I thought the large restaurant with so many people was overwhelming. While it was a bit off putting, I took it as a good sign that this place is so popular and liked by people, that it's very packed. To start the meal, we got the vegetable samosas, and the keema pau. Both were the highlight of the meal for me. The vegetable samosas were tasty, and the keema pau was just as good. My main dish is where I think Dishoom failed. I got the Dishoom Chicken Teeka Roll and it was pretty bad. The roll was very dry, there was hardly any taste to it. I have to say, after hearing such great reviews about Dishoom, I was really disappointed. I'm not one to believe in the ""you got the wrong dish"" mentality. I think every dish should be good at a restaurant, not just a specific one. My sister got the mattar paneer and really liked it. I wanted to like Dishoom because of the great reviews, but it just wasn't as spectacular as people say. The service was great, the atmosphere was cool (but overwhelming), and my main dish was lackluster. Would I visit Dishoom again? Probably. I would see if I could pick a better dish and enjoy it more (even though this goes against my usual judgement)."
15/3/2015,5 star rating,"I have fallen in love with Dishoom. They might have exploded in number of stores, and it may look a little too popular indeed, but the design and decor is very beautiful - and so are the foods. It's both beautiful and delicious. Very delicious actually. I can't say anything bad actually. The house chai was extremely rich, intense and tasty - oh, and it is bottomless too. My breakfast lassi was freshly prepared with a cold and creamy consistency. Spot on. Finally my house granola was delicious also. The housemade granola was crunchy and buttery, while the vanilla yoghurt tasted good too. Fresh fruit was actually - and always surprisingly - fresh and sweet. I can't wait to come back. Both for other breakfasts, but also to try the lunch and dinner."
8/3/2019,5 star rating,"Five stars is right. I can't say this is the best Indian in London (sample size of one) but I can tell you that this was a fantastic meal that was comparable to the best I've had elsewhere. We ate around the menu and had fantastic cocktails. I think rather than detail each part of the meal, I'd rather suggest that you go outside of your comfort zone and eat something other than what you're familiar with. The Indio-Persian cuisine is fantastic and should be something to explore. You can get good Tika Masala in so many places. You owe it to yourself to explore."
11/6/2019,5 star rating,A must try in London. A favorite among both locals and tourists. Great value for London. Much trendier than expected. Super friendly staff. Food was spot on.
19/6/2018,4 star rating,Delicious food and has a nice selection of vegetarian dishes. If you have not booked a table ahead of time it can be difficult/ a long wait to be seated. Great place for small groups. Also the brunch is delicious! Would definitely recommend.
31/12/2017,5 star rating,"Not overly spicy food, perfectly flavored and just delicious! From the naan to the tandoori chicken, the grilled shrimp and black dahl were some of my favorites."
26/12/2019,5 star rating,"Make a reservation before you go! We waited in the que for a while and it was so worth it!! Amazing wait staff, great drinks, and delicious food. The smell alone coming from the kitchen was alluring and the taste did not disappoint. Worth the price point!"
29/12/2017,5 star rating,"Hands down my favorite Indian food I've had thus far! Being from the Bay Area we have tons of good Indian restaurants but you guys are something else! The restaurant had this cool hip/fun vibe that you'd find in NYC, with very traditional flavors but with a modern twist. We ordered pretty much everything on the menu, our waitress probably thought we were crazy, as she tried to stop us & said this is plenty... Everything was delicious! Oh & those 3 little sauces they give you...ask for more as you will want more later! lol To top it off the service was great. Can't wait to come back again when I'm back in London. Wish you guys would open a location in SF!"
6/5/2019,5 star rating,"I was taken here by a friend who lives in London and is a regular at this place. I can see why!  Absolutely amazing food, decor and service. Our waiter hinted at plans to open a NYC location...I really, really hope that happens soon."
2/10/2019,5 star rating,"Heard so much about this restaurant in reviews and food.apps, while the ambiance meets expectations, the food is definitely good. I'm so glad I visited this restaurant."
31/8/2019,4 star rating,Waited for almost 50 mins and it was all worth it! Definitely going back to this place with my family/friends.
20/7/2015,5 star rating,"This is THE Indian restaurant to go to in London!  It was well worth the wait (which can end up being one hour.  The restaurant was kind enough to offer free drinks for those waiting in line.  Service was all great.  Our waitress did try to sneak in a lot of extra charges, like ""oh this dish really needs naan or rice with it, which do you want? (without mentioning the extra fee), so be aware of that. The food was fantastic.  The best Indian food I've tasted.  No wonder the place is so popular.  If you don't mind the wait, I'd really reccommend this popular place.  Probably better to go during an off hour though. Prices are decent especially for the quality of food."
16/7/2015,4 star rating,"I've come here twice and loved my experience both times. The first time I came for dinner on a Friday night, and the wait time for our party of 3 was around 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad. After we finished (around 8 pm, I'm guessing), the line was HUGE so I'd recommend getting here earlier rather than later. The second time (today) we - a party of 9 - came for lunch and the wait time was just around 15 minutes. I know Dishoom recommends ordering ""family style"" but all of us ordered our own dishes and shared for tastes. I opted for the Chicken Tikka with a side of Garlic Naan, and might I say that I REALLY enjoyed it. The portion size was perfect for me (maybe even a little too much) and I finished all of what I ordered. The spice level was just right, too, especially when paired with the naan. Everyone else in our party also really enjoyed their meal, and we all left happy, satisfied, and in (slight) food comas. The environment here is pretty awesome too. It seems really modern and the decor is on point. The staff is also amazing and definitely contributed to my great experience here both times. The minus one star is only because I'm not the biggest fan of Indian food to begin with, but I'm pretty sure this is as good as it gets - or it's the best I've had, at least."
16/12/2015,5 star rating,"DIshoom is one of my favorite restaurants in London. I went there twice on my last visit. I always get the vegetable samosas as a starter - they are crispy and come with three great chutneys (the mint chutney being my favorite). When ordering a main dish one thing to note is that few of Dishoom's items are curry-based, meaning that they are just meat options. If you want something with a curry Mattar Paneer or the Chicken Ruby. I'm a huge fan of the chicken ruby - it's the perfect mix of spicy flavorful and goes well with the Romali Roti. I've also had Lamb Boti Kabobs and the Dishoom Chicken Tikka - both are great but again they just come with meat so I don't recommend ordering a naan or rice with it. This restaurant is usually quite crowded during prime lunch and dinner time but the wait was never terribly long for me. Overall: one of my favorites in London, amazing Indian food, cool ambiance"
20/8/2020,4 star rating,"Great food and really friendly service and cannot wait to go again , I loved the Ruby Chicken , very cozy and great setting."
28/5/2019,5 star rating,"There was a wait to get in but it was so worth it! The wait felt like it was run very efficiently, first outside, then inside to the bar. Staff also offered food for those who had been fasting for Ramadan, a very kind and thoughtful gesture. Once we were sent to the bar, the downstairs staff greeted us by name, and to take us to our table, we were once again greeted by name and taken to our table. The staff's coordination between each other was remarkable. Once we were seated our very kind waitress went over the menu with us. We ended up getting quite a bit: garlic naan, chicken Tikka, Ruby chicken, samosas, behl, and potatoes and all of it was amazing! We ate until we were full and then some it was so good! The food was served family-style and was brought out as soon as it was ready. If we're ever back in London we'll definitely go back!"
11/4/2017,5 star rating,"Indian comfort food at its best! We came around 4 and were seated right away. No lines! I ordered the Bollybellini, lamb samosas, prawn kaliwada, okra fries, the chicken ruby, and the garlic naan. The food was excellent and the service was swift and efficient. I looked forward to visiting this restaurant and they have exceeded my expectations. Well done!"
2/7/2019,5 star rating,"So getting a table here is ridiculously difficult, and then when you get there, you're drinking out of steel tumblers and the bathroom looks like a chemist shop in a small Indian town and the whole thing feels a bit Disney or Epcot.  Like a fake film set.  But the food, whoa!  this is the real deal. First of all, as an American, I have never had Indian food outside of India be this real. That chai, is some old school railway station tea, and those samosas were EXACTLY how my mom made them, not sure how they knew that. Husband got the chole bhatura and dang if it didn't come with that weird dry halwa on the side the way my Bihari MIL makes it. I'm South Indian, husband is North Indian, I'm still not sure how they got so much of it right. If you don't like Dishoom, then you don't like Indian food because this is the legit sitch. Some of it was too salty the way my MIL makes it too LOL."
2/7/2019,5 star rating,The food was great! We had a wonderful server who even knew the history of the restaurant and the influences! Loved the chicken curry. Would definitely come back here to try other offerings
26/5/2019,5 star rating,Love dishoom. The food is always great and the service is solid. You will always be in for a wait but that's just the price of admission here.
1/4/2019,5 star rating,"Soooo good - we had the prawn koliwada, chili chicken, chicken ruby, spicy lamb chops and chicken tikka (we were hungry) - it did not disappoint!! Really good - highly recommend!! Every dish was full of flavor and did not disappoint"
26/12/2016,4 star rating,"I've heard from many people that London has fantastic Indian food, so what better place to start than the most reviewed place on Yelp? Dishoom has a wait that exceeds one hour for most of the day during peak meal times - be prepared for this by either making reservations or being willing to wait. They are definitely prepped for the amount of people they get each day, though! If you come for dinner, they'll have hot tea for you while you wait in line. Around twenty minutes into the line, they'll take you inside to the bar area where you can order drinks and appetizers while you wait for a table to clear up. Once you have a table, you can go and order all of the food that you want. I'm a huge fan of their ruby chicken, garlic naan, and Dishoom chicken tikka. Also, the potatoes that they serve are fantastic. I ordered a drink at the bar - it was a chai-infused apple cider, but it was a bit of a miss for me (and a little on the pricey side £6.50 a bottle). Overall, come here if you want some great Indian food in the heart of London - if you can deal with the wait, it'll definitely be worth your while!"
30/6/2019,5 star rating,"Exceptional food , exceptional service. We waited 45 minutes and it was well worth the wait. The grilled entrees were amazing with incredible cheesy nan. Make sure to come hungry. The food is amazing!!  So worth the wait. And the chocolate pudding with citrus chili ice cream absolutely fabulous!!!  Come here if you go to any restaurant - by far the best Indian food in London. Ask for Anita she is wonderful!!!"
22/4/2019,5 star rating,"This is a late review, dined here in January 2018. We first tried to get in at the Covent Garden location but the line was out the door. We got lucky walking by on Carnaby Street. The wait wasn't too long so we put our name down and hit the bar. We were promptly seated and ordered a selection of recommendations from our waiter. I was blown away by the flavors and how good everything was. I can see why there's always a line out the door. If you're in London this is a must try, we even bought the CD."
29/6/2019,5 star rating,The wait was worth it!  Every dish we had was just delicious!  Have visited several of the Dishoom restaurants in London!
26/4/2017,5 star rating,"OMG - want to go for awesome, fantastic, delicious Indian while in London? Don't be discouraged by the wait as it moves fairly fast. But you have to try this place - it is phenomenal. You have to try the Bollybellini drink (we had 2 each it was so good),  then ask your waiter for some suggestions especially if you're more into spicy (SUPER HOT) food or not. We had a blast and it is definitely worth going back again!"
22/5/2017,3 star rating,"A contemporary take on Indian food. I felt like this place was over-hyped. The atmosphere is cool, but the food is average. You can definitely find better desi food elsewhere. The wait was a little long (for a Sunday evening) and they don't take reservations for groups smaller than 6. However, while you wait you can have some chai (it has more spices than usual), water, or lemon water. Which was a nice thing while you wait. We waited about an hour for a Sunday evening around 9:30. The menu had a lot of options, some traditional and some they have made their own versions of. From everything we ordered - the seekh kabobs were the best."
22/2/2017,5 star rating,"What is there to say that hasn't been said hundreds of times? Best Indian food I've ever had at such affordable prices. Had spiced prawns for the first time which were perfectly cooked with a nice kick to them. Only take reservations up to 5:45pm so if you're able to eat early, definitely do that to avoid the insane lines"
14/3/2019,4 star rating,"The food was great, the service was closer to a three. We enjoyed our multiple dishes- excellent shrimp, black daal, ruby chicken, and two orders of the garlic na'an. But waiting for our server to order a second, beer, refill water, order naan was like pulling out eyelashes. We were not impressed with our server."
2/11/2016,5 star rating,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. I am not exaggerating. If anyone ever asks me what my favorite restaurant is, this is it. The only acceptable answer. I ate here in May to celebrate a birthday. It was raining, as it so often is in London, but the long line seemed to pass by quickly as we were served different kinds of chai while we waited to be seated. Once inside, the wait at the bar was wonderful and filled with samosas and red wine. I had the mattar paneer, black dhal, cheese naan, and chocolate chai. Every single thing was absolutely amazing, especially the black dhal. Dhal is served everywhere, but I have never had dhal like this, it's warm and comforting and exiting all in one and amazing with cheese naan. The chocolate chai is incredible, it's like a spiced hot chocolate tea, and I loved it. I loved Dishoom so much that I went for breakfast later that week at their location in Shoreditch, which was also amazing. Highly recommend the masala beans there. I LOVE DISHOOM. I wish there was a word to better express the extent of the deliciousness."
15/9/2017,4 star rating,"After waiting in line for more than an hour on a blustery, chilly London evening, I had high expectations and a roiling appetite. I was not disappointed. The chocolate chai and mint tea served to those waiting in line certainly warmed my insides. And then, the business begins. I ordered the black daal, lamb biryani, and the garlic naan. Our server thought I was ordering for my friend and I, but I just wanted to try everything! If I had the option to take leftovers home, I would've ordered the Ruby Chicken. The daal was rich,  smoky and flavorful-- perfectly partnered with the naan! You forget it doesn't have meat. The lamb biryani had a subtle, slow-burning heat. It's the kind of meal that makes you say, ""that hit the spot!"" But as delightful as dinner was, I had to save room for dessert. I'm glad I did. The kulfi was so rich and creamy, it was almost chewy. It was almost custard. If you are ever within the vicinity of this place, make sure you get in line! Build up an appetite and know it will be worth the wait!"
27/11/2018,5 star rating,"I will say, not being a huge fan of Indian room, I was trying to avoid coming here during our trips to London. But I finally caved this time as my husband (who really likes Indian food) really want to come. We came here for breakfast so I can only speak to their breakfast menu, but oh god how I was wrong to judge so soon. First of all, the chai was amazing. And FREE REFILL! How great is that. I order the bacon egg naan wrap. The egg was top quality - semi-running and great orange colored yolk. I was a bit unsure about the sauce but it went really well with the dish. My husband had one of their breakfast dish (forgot the name) and he devoured too. The experience was so amazing that we came back a second time the very next morning! I definitely recommend anyone who's visiting the UK to give Dishoom a try - and this is coming from someone who's always been reserved about Indian food."
10/9/2017,1 star rating,"Terrible place!  I never ever take time to write reviews, but this place was so bad it has brought me here to write my first ever bad review. They literally ruined our dining experience over water.  My girlfriend mistakenly ordered distilled water when she didn't mean to.  I remember the waiter framed the question in a way to deliberately confuse with only two options.  In any case, I am less shy than my gf, so I spoke up for her and let them know that's not what we wanted.  So they brought us regular water instead. Then a few minutes later the waiter walks over just to argue with us about the water. Completely unnecessary.  I calmly replied like an adult that it must have been a miscommunication then.  The guy just crapped all over our mood with his negative tone and arguing.  I was dumbfounded as he walked away from the table with his disrespectful tone with us.  We spent the whole dinner talking about what a terrible place this is.  We waited an hour in line in the rain for this terrible treatment.   The food is not worth it.  You're paying for the ambiance and experience which was bad.  Either they have bad staff, or they are pressured by management to upsell the customers. Summary: Don't go here!  Better options elsewhere!"
10/4/2015,4 star rating,"Definitely one of the more unique Indian restaurants I've been to. London obviously has it's fair share of great Indian places, but this one had something that stood out. The dishes were a lot less sauce-y than more typical Indian restaurants I've been to. The standout on the menu for me was the Dishoom calamari, which was absolutely amazing. Black house daal and the chicken berry brittania biryani were good as well. The garlic naan was a bit butterier than I would have preferred, but that's just a personal preference. The restaurant is obviously very popular and we went waited for about 45-60 minutes for a table on a Saturday afternoon around 3 pm. No complaints though-it was worth the wait."
29/4/2018,5 star rating,"Dishoom is simply fantastic!!! Great atmosphere, the best service and the tastiest food ...no matter what you order! The popularity of this place has grown over the years and most times you have to queue to get in, but it's simply worth it! Can't recommend this place enough ...you will not be disappointed!"
11/11/2017,4 star rating,This place was absolutely delish! Tried the fried okra and it was out of this world! Waited in line for more than 30 mins but they give you a delish chai or green mint tea!
8/9/2019,5 star rating,"One of the most popular restaurants in the area. Even for breakfast the place is filled with people. Food is excellent. The staff is organized and clearly well trained. The price is surprisingly low. If you are coming here with a friend, I recommend sharing food."
15/3/2015,5 star rating,"Well. Wow. What an amazing place. We got there early.. 5.45pm and there were lots of tables but these were all gone by 6pm so if you come in the evening be prepared to queue. I think it says volumes about a place when people are prepared to queue outside a place for up to an hour in the middle of winter. The waiter was so friendly and took time to discuss the whole menu. In the end we pretty much let him choose. My favourites were the lamb chops spiced to perfection and served sprinkled in pomegranate seeds, and the okra fries. The food was quite spicy but with some yoghurt dip my mouth was cooled. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a delicious dinner. And who doesn't want that!"
12/1/2019,4 star rating,"Dishoom is always a good time! The lines are long, but the tea they serve while you wait does help. Staff are always friendly even when it's swamped. I recommend going for dinner over brunch. The variety in the menu and quality of the food make it worth the lines."
11/5/2019,5 star rating,"My favorite Indian food experience with a mix of traditional and unique dishes. Lively crowd, energetic staff, and great music. Love the vibe. BE PREPARED to wait in line for a table at dinner time - anywhere from 30-60 minutes. You can book reservations for breakfast and lunch but only groups of six can book for dinner. So so delicious; I always find it worth the wait."
28/10/2016,5 star rating,"Best meal of my life. My heart and belly are content. Visiting from NYC and would gladly have it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
27/8/2017,5 star rating,"I would give this restaurant more than 5 stars if I could. Their food is exceptional, the service is outstanding, and if I were local, I would eat here all the time (on one short vacation, we dined here 3 times in 2 days). London prides itself on its Indian food, but the Indian food I've usually eaten had tastes a little different from what you get in restaurants in the U.S. or India. I've come to think of it as its own category: ""London Indian"" (sort of like ""Indian Chinese"" or ""American Chinese"" food). Dishoom's food is incredibly Mumbai-authentic (from the chai to the the oh-so-delicious chutneys), executed with really high quality ingredients. In particular, I'd recommend the jackfruit biryani (rice casserole with raisins and cooked jackfruit -- a vegetarian alternative to chicken... it looks like chicken but tastes sort of like artichoke hearts). The tikka chicken wrap was amazingly delicious (actually, the balance of flavors wrapped in that thin, papery roti reminded me of mooshu chicken), and my Indian husband declared the bhel puri the best he'd had outside of India. The line for lunch and dinner can get very long (45 minutes for lunch or just over an hour for dinner), so try to come a little early (just before noon for lunch) or make a reservation."

23/12/2019,1 star rating,"We are visiting from the United States and someone told us to give this place a try. So I called to make reservations and left several messages, no one ever called us back. No one here will answer your call. On the ninth time, someone did answer, but he refused to take a reservations or even look. He rudely told me to call back. There are several other good Indian restaurants in this town. We will take our business there."
4/7/2017,5 star rating,"I dont usually wait in line too long but the reviews were so good and we were from out of town didnt want to miss opportunity, it was worth the hour wait. Food was incredible? I would call it gormet indian food. For me the best. Nan bread was fresh made and baked before your eyes. They were made very thin which was great. Had chicken curry which was perfectly done and the most tender lambchops i have had at an restuarant. Pricing is resonable for food and wsine."
17/3/2015,4 star rating,"I looove a good Indian place and when my friend told me that London is the place to go for the best Indian restaurant, I was all down for it. This place gets extremely packed and will get a crazy lane if you go too late, so we made sure to get there by 5:30pm and got seated quickly. I think we pretty much ordered the whole menu since it was like a tapas style where the dishes come out pretty small but packed with so much flavor. I think I may have just about every veggie dish on the menu plus the calamari and they did not disappoint. The mango lassi was also very good. My tummy definitely left the place pretty satisfied, that's for sure. Our waiter and the service there was great and I will definitely come back if I'm ever in London again!"
1/9/2016,5 star rating,"Dishoom was so good. Most of the reviews on Yelp probably already explain it all but to reiterate, I am very satisfied with my time there. I came by on my way to the airport so I was by myself but the food is definitely prepared in a way for sharing. I would love to go back with a group and try a bunch more things. The staff was very accommodating to me, the put my luggage in the back room which was amazing. It took up way too much room anyways. There was a line but it goes quick and it really is worth it. They send you down to the bar first and then when a table is ready they seat you. I didn't try any of the drinks this time around but they looked great. I definitely want to come back and experience Dishoom again :)"
25/7/2019,5 star rating,"When we walked by the Coal Drop Yards location for Dishoom and the line was around the corner, we knew we had to go there. And boy are we glad we did! Every dish we ordered was yummy. When we were flying back home to the US, my daughter said, I wish we could go to Dishoom right now."
19/7/2019,5 star rating,"When we first arrived to our air bnb we took a walk to Coal Drop yards in search of dinner. Dishoom had a line around the building. We made a point to come back. The food was outstanding! We ordered Black Dahl, Naann Paneer Palak, samosas, and more. We had an early supper and avoided the lines."
17/10/2017,5 star rating,"Amazing service! The warm chai as we waited outside was delicious. As soon as we neared the front of the line, we were taken downstairs to the bar and ordered drinks there. Soon after, we were seated and the food came out quickly. AWESOME service and delicious food! A must go to place for those on vacation!"
13/8/2017,5 star rating,"I'm from the states so my opinion may be hindered due to the fact that Indian/Pakistani restaurants here are on a whole other level (way better here than the states). This place got 5 stars and we had a one hour twenty minute wait, so that should tell you something. We killed the starters. The lamb samosas were very simple and tasty. The best starters were the lamb boti and lamb chops. The kabab were also very great however the boti and chops were my favorite. We all got full off of the starters so shared the chicken curry dish which was good too... We got seated downstairs however if you want more of an experience I would suggest to be asked to be seated upstairs. The service was great as well."
11/2/2017,5 star rating,Ruby chicken still is an amazing dish - chicken never tasted so flavorful! Chicken tikka is done dry here and is a great twist on the national dish of UK. Black house daal packs a lot of flavor for just some lentil beans. Would come back in a heart beat
14/8/2016,5 star rating,"Easily one of the best Indian meals I've ever had. Expect a long wait even at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon! This place definitely feels more chic and upscale even if it's meant to be casual. The fried okra (5/5) - incredibly tasty The chicken curry (4.5/5) - one of the best curries I've ever had. You could skip it if you want something more interesting as it's more like the best rendition of a classic dish rather than anything transformative. Lamb Samosa (4/5) - tasty, small, but very one noted -- I wish there was something else in there as well. Overall, it's worth the wait in my humble opinion."
21/10/2016,4 star rating,"Oooh the chicken ruby dish here has changed the way I think about my chicken in Indian food and curries. Recently I'd been finding myself avoiding chicken at Indian restaurants (in America) because of how hard I've been finding the pieces - like solid, blocks of tough meat that became a nuisance to bite into. Even in places that people rave about, I've found chicken to be unfortunately blah after countless times. So I was a little wary to have chicken here, but I was also curious to see how it would compare. The waiter wasn't particularly helpful really, but one of the things he did list was the chicken ruby. So after some indecision, I decided on that and roti (a recommended pair on the menu), and chai tea. So worth the roughly hour-long wait in line (I arrived around 5 pm on a Wednesday). The chicken was tender and broke off easily with fork in one hand. The curry was so complex (it had a good balance of spice and it wasn't too sweet as if simply tomato soup or heavily tomato-based). The roti did pair really well with it, soaking it all up. And it was the perfect amount together, which I find rare! Initially it might look like you don't have enough of one or the other, but no worries, ends up striking a nice balance and being filling."
6/10/2016,3 star rating,"Came with really high expectations given the reviews and the line. Lamb Samosas - Came out really fast. Were not hot or fresh. Tasted like they had been cooked earlier in the day and left under a warmer. The homemade samosas from my co-workers taste so much better. Chicken Ruby - Tasted like it was made with canned tomato sauce. Lamb Biryani - Again lamb was tough and not tender. Almost chalky, which again makes me think ""not fresh"". I cook with lamb very often and it's not difficult to get it tender. Rice had great flavor though. Garlic Naan - Very good Mango Kulfi - Very good The Line - As I finished my meal I counted the number of empty seats upstairs and downstairs when I went to the restroom...the number of empty seats exceeded the number of people standing in line, which was about 20 people. So why the line? To create false sense of exclusivity or popularity? Or are there simply not enough staff to handle a full restaurant? Overall, I say it's okay but not worth an 1+ hour wait in line."
29/4/2019,5 star rating,This place blew away my expectations. The Mutton Spicy Curry and I loved every bite. I would recommend it for anyone that wants serious Indian food.
30/3/2018,5 star rating,"The food is amazing!!!! My girlfriend and I wanted some Indian food while experiencing London and found this spot on Yelp! Boy am I glad we came. The food was amazing and the service was great. We split 4 dishes, garlic naan and some rice. Our favorite was the the spicy Lamb chops. Can be a bit pricey, but well worth it."
28/3/2019,5 star rating,"It might be a chain ... but definitely worth the visit when in London!!! Make sure to make a reservation and don't be shy, order an alcoholic bevy because it's the icing on the cake when grabbing a bite to eat at Dishoom!"
5/9/2016,5 star rating,"Don't wait in the hour plus line, instead make a reservation online a day before! This is one of the more popular Indian restaurant in London and a favorite of my office that's around the block. It's a bit more expensive but everyone raves it's the best Indian food they've had (even my coworker who only eats Mexican and was afraid to try the food loved it!!!). The ambiance was particularly trendy and the decor was modern. They have a nice variety of drinks with good service. You can't go wrong with a the highlight on the Yelp reviews or just ask your wait staff for some favorites. I would recommend coming here if you are craving some food Indian food."
30/10/2016,5 star rating,Absolute best meal I had while visiting London. I also visited the Carnaby location but this one was better.  Crispy shrimp appetizer was much better here. Highly recommend the black dal and ruby chicken (pretty much a murgh makhani). Great service. Go early to avoid the line/queue.  Small underground bar. Order a classic old fashioned not the one they have on the menu. I forgot to add save space for the chocolate pudding with chili ice cream. The best desert I had in London as well.  Basically the best lava cake you've ever had with mild chili ice cream. Perfection.
16/1/2017,4 star rating,"Review for Dishoom in Covent Garden! This place is popular so just expect no matter what time you arrive, you will be waiting in line.  If you are lucky, only 10-15 minutes, but it can be as high as 60 minutes. However, they probably manage to make a long wait not seem as long by compartmentalizing you and keeping you moving. If you are outside, every 10 minutes they bring around fresh hot chai to keep you warm.  Within about 25 minutes, they move you to a new waiting area by the bar.  You hang out there, have a drink, check out the menu, etc.  By the time you are at your table, you already know your order, probably a little tipsy from your well crafted pre-dinner cocktail and ready to chow down on delicious food. With this menu and with the usual blandness of English food, you really cannot go wrong with anything.  However a few items are my go-tos: Chicken Ruby: This is what most people confuse as Chicken Tikka Masala.  Deliciously done and properly with a hint of cashew to thicken the sauce. Chicken Tikka Roll: If you ever had a Kati Roll or Frankie, this is a classic preparation of the street food style from Bombay. Kachumber Salad: A refreshing and citrus salad to help with the palette cleanse between the heavier meal dishes Lamb Samosas: Your classic samosas but with Keema instead. Pau Bhaji: Just comfort food for Indians but the burst of flavors is bound to make anyone hungrier for more. Malai Kulfi for dessert: This is the one item that is pretty good but can't beat India.  It's certainly good and will hit that kulfi craving."
23/2/2015,5 star rating,"D' ya like Indian food? Come here! Looking for flavors that delight and bring joy to your body? You must come here! Came here for breakfast and the menu was amazing, so many great dishes on offer. How many breakfast dishes can I order and not waste too much food, I wonder, as I read the menu from top to bottom, and learned quite a bit, actually. The last time I was in Mumbai (Bombay) I had a wonderful dish for breakfast, and here it was on the menu at Dishoom: Kejriwal- Imagine slices of bread covered in herbal/mustard cheese topped with a poached egg, the softness of the bread soaking up the egg yolk, the fat from the cheese, the rich taste of mustard, all of it swirling in your mouth and on your palate...so comforting, so unique. Needless to say, this meal led to another the next afternoon, where we sat downstairs near a heaving bar. Another amazing meal, the two of us just short of stuffed to the max. Wanna try something really strange, and strangely tasty? Kala Khatta Gola Ice All I can say is what an amazing melange of tastes in one rather simple appearing dish, it's just chipped ice with a few blueberries, right? Oh hella no, order it and find out! 5+ stars! As our former Governor Arnold said~ I'll be back! Enjoy!"
26/5/2019,5 star rating,"Excellent Indian food. We tried the house special lamb shank biriyani under a pastry shell.it was amazing. We also had the chicken curry and lamb chops. All the dishes were well spiced, flavorful and attractively presented."
4/3/2018,5 star rating,"I was craving Indian food in London and decided to go to Dishoom. It was long 45 min wait at 7pm but they were super nice and offered us hot Indian chai and sherry as we waited outside in the line. Once inside, we really liked the vibrant and clean ambience with lingering indian spices from across tables. We ordered Keema Pau, Vada Pau, Bhel and Pav Bhaji for starters. Loved envy dish since it was cooked to perfection without any excess oil. Went in big group with Europeans and Americans and everyone could eat it without compromising on their spice-level threshold. For the main course we ordered Chicken Ruby, Chicken biryani, Black daal, Roomali roti and Garlic naan. The biryani and dal were spot on. Wasn't too impressed with the ruby as it lacked the flavour and was bit bland. We wrapped out meal with kulfi and chai - hard to go wrong on these! Service was great, waiters were friendly and we got complimentary far far. It was a reasonably priced restaurant and didn't burn a hole with all the food that we ordered. Overall, great food and service. Felt at home in this cosy restaurant and will definitely visit again!"
28/11/2017,3 star rating,"Good food all around. Authentic indian ambience and food was very good. Some small niggles, the water glasses were smelly and the chopped onion we asked for were stale."
15/9/2017,5 star rating,"Great place great price. Order to you're heart's content and you won't go broke. Only problem is the wait so make reservations. If you can't, you still get a complimentary chai tea as you wait. On a cold day, it's definitely something you want. Don't know what to order? Don't worry, the staff is extremely helpful and patient in making sure that you know what you are ordering. Portions aren't that big, but for the price, it's still a great bargain. We ordered the prawn special and it was excellent. The flavors are well balanced and the prawn are fresh. We also made sure we ordered 2 naans to soak up the rest of the juices of the dish. This is how you should eat soupy dishes in my opinion."
3/7/2016,5 star rating,"The hype is real. There was an hour long wait when we arrived at 8:30 and continued to be the case when we left at 10:30. Once you do finally score a table, the food comes out quickly after ordering, but you can also while away the time sipping on their many delicious libation offerings. The food is so good! Perfectly seasoned, spiced and cooked. We didn't have one bad bite. My life was changed as soon as I sunk my teeth into cheese naan, which I didn't even know existed!!! My two kids (ages 4 & 8) had Indian food for the first time here...Dishoom may have set the bar too high, whoops!"
28/5/2016,1 star rating,I really wanted to write a 4 star review after my lunch several weeks ago but I can't... The food was really delicious but 1/2 weeks after we had lunch at Dishoom they send me an email telling me (in a diverted but not subtle way)that they would love to offer me breakfast if I put a good review on yelp or trip advisor. It is a shame to do such things and I really don't understand since they have hundreds of really good reviews... Here I am Dishoom with my 1 star review!
21/5/2019,4 star rating,I ordered their signature dishes and the food was good. It's not the best food I've had but definitely an option worth considering in London.
27/2/2018,5 star rating,I high recommended. Friendly people and good atmosphere. This is my second time i have been in this restaurant and always keeps a nice food and still in high demand...
1/12/2018,4 star rating,"I went to this place for dinner a few times, always a huge line in front of the restaurant, i really don't understand. However, the price is affordable and the food here is quite nice, but staffs are too busy to give u enough attention . So 4.5 star is my rating"
11/12/2016,1 star rating,"After looking at the yelp reviews, went there on my second day in London.  There was a line outside and was told a wait of 1 1/2 hrs.  Hmmm,  decided nothing can be worth that wait,  walked around covent Garden and had pretty good food at 'punjab' restaurant.   A few days pass and I was walking around the area, saw the line wasn't too big,  decided to take the leap. It was a looong wait, an hour in the cold outside. Finally I was shown in and directed to the bar in the basement cos my table was apparently still not ready. It was a little surprising as I was walking by a bunch of empty tables. The bar area was mostly empty,  it could easily absorb almost everyone standing in the line outside in the cold..  But hey,  that's not my worry..  As I am inside now and it is warm..  Nice. Finally I am shown to the table that was empty all the time I was standing at the bar. The menu is unique by basically having a few different choices but mostly just renaming most of the usual Indian restaurant food. By this time I am just excited to be sitting at my table and I go ahead and order the usual chicken and paneer dishes. And now I wait... Well actually, the wait was not long..  Surprisingly it just took them two mins to bring my food..  Part of me was very excited till I started to taste cold chicken tikka, cold romali roti and chicken Ruby which was just a bland tasting butter chicken with dry boneless chicken pieces ... Suggestions -  don't make people wait for hours in the cold to make the demand appear to be above capacity. Try and make food at order so it gets to the table not cold like it was waiting to be picked up ten mins ago. Overall - like I said earlier,  most of the time, no food Is worth an hour waiting in line, freezing London cold or not. If you are one of those folks reading reviews standing in that line, Take this advice - Go walk over to Talli Joe, a 5 mins walk to Soho and enjoy better food and amazing cocktails."
20/2/2018,5 star rating,"Oh, Dishoom. You were wonderful. In dire need of Indian food on a cold London evening, we found Dishoom through raving reviews online and once we got there its popularity was clear: the wait was permanently an hour and 30 minutes- there was even a line to wait for the 1h30m line!  We wanted to understand the hype and ended up waiting about an hour (I think they try to throw people off with that long time) and all the while they serve hot spiced chai- delicious. Once we were in, I asked what the waiter's favorite dish was, chicken ruby, and tried that. We paired it alongside their lamb biryani and a cucumber salad veggie dish. The food was DELICIOUS. Definitely try the chicken ruby! So so good, we even came back and tried the suggestion of another waiter, malak paneer (just.omg.incredible!), the chicken biryani and garlic naan. Everything was well worth the wait! Some small downsides: the cider I tried here definitely is an acquired taste. I love ciders, and if you do too maybe give it a go, but it seemed to be watered down and a little spiced? Not my favorite. Otherwise, the dishes themselves can be on the medium/small side, and the mains don't come with any rice, bread, or veggie sides. So if you're ordering chicken tikka, that doesn't come with a side of rice, or a piece of garlic naan, or a small veggie dish. I'd keep that in mind, as the price can stack up quickly when you add all of those combinations up. Either way, Dishoom was delicious  and worth the hype! The atmosphere was an interesting old school London/Indian 60s and 70s vibe? Great experience!"
28/7/2018,5 star rating,"the hype is real. the food here was amazing so absolutely worth the wait. recommendations: okra fries bhel roti lamb samosas chicken ruby chicken & pomegranate the ambience is trendy, fun & full of culture."
2/7/2019,5 star rating,Great food and ambiance. Best Indian food I've had. Long line but moves pretty quickly. Fun section of town too. Dishes for every member of the family. Highly recommend!
30/12/2018,5 star rating,"Yes it is worth the wait.  Yes the food is every bit as good as reviews say.  Yes it is value for money.  Make the trek to one of the many Dishooms, indulge and enjoy!"
18/10/2016,1 star rating,"I can't believe this place is getting such excellent reviews! No, I'm really shocked! The food is so commercial but then again I saw a lot of tourists in line. Yes, there is a line to get into this place, and yes, I waited on it! So annoyed that I did. There were empty tables for way too long as people waited out in the cold. They are not seating people intentionally to cast an impression that people are dying to get in! Back to food: salty, commercial Indian. My Ruby chicken was cold. My okra fries were way too salty. This is basically the TJ Friday's of Indian! Man, what a hoax."
26/10/2016,4 star rating,"he first time we were here, there was a waiting of an hour and we decided to pass on it. The second time after a wait of 30 mins we got a table. The place is nice , always packed with people. They have some bolloywood names to the drinks which is quite interesting. The service is quite good considering they are so busy. I loved their keema pau . It had the right spice and was awesome. We also got chicken ruby which was oK (mild) . They have a unique menu and must recommended for the experience !"
16/5/2016,5 star rating,"My fellow Americans, you need to get your butts here for a meal before that old orange turd running as the GOP's 2016 presidential candidate decides to ban England, Indian food and god knows what else. Which would be ironic because the curry here is so delicious and potent he could probably bottle it and market it as 'Trump Spray Tan'. The wait staff is awesome: they helped guide us through the expansive menu, pick items to our taste and pair them with other great options. I wish I could tell you what we ordered but I can't pronounce any of it. Sorry Donald but THESE guys have the best words."
23/6/2019,5 star rating,"Breakfast at Dhishoom is my go to for any trip to London, bun muska and chai make up for a long flight and then some.   It is always hard to decide between Akuri or Kejriwal because they are both so so good."
28/10/2017,2 star rating,Not worth the wait in line if you're craving the taste of real Indian food. Samosas had a tough plastic like skin. Chai was good but very sweet. The corn was like any other corn and extra salty. Potato was bland. Okra fries wasn't great. Overall I've had much better Indian and can get far better in nyc for the same and less money easily. You pay for the hype and ambiance here. That's it.
15/8/2017,5 star rating,This is the best Indian food in London!! I am so happy my husband and I found this place. What a lunch feast to remember lol  It's interesting how different their Chicken tikka masala compared to ours here in the US. Dishoom is definitely the highlight of our food trip in London. Come early to avoid the long wait.
23/6/2019,5 star rating,"Sunday at about 1pm, we only waited about 10 minutes in the queue. A lemon drink was provided courteously.  The butter chicken curry had a lemon zest that lifted the flavour sublimely. The mutton special was tasty as well the naan and prawn appetiser. We were very pleased with the service and left satisfied with our experience here."
27/2/2019,5 star rating,"Fantastic.   For dinner waited 25 minutes in line outside, then 10 minutes at bar.  Well worth the wait.  Fantastic experience.  Delicious food, excellent service, reasonable prices and cool atmosphere!   We got several of their specialties and loved it.  Will return on next trip to London."
28/4/2015,5 star rating,"I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars because of the overall experience. My sister and I came to London for 3 days on a vacation and heard that the curry in london is great in general. I was looking a place at to eat, and this was the first one that popped up and read the reviews (which were positive) and decided to go there. When we first got there, the place was packed and there were people waiting to be seated. We were told that the wait time was going to be 25 minutes, to us that was fine. They told us that we were Able to wait downstairs at the bar. 10 minutes later, we got a table. The server was super nice and understanding. She explained everything to us perfectly. For starters, we got lamb samosas, which comes two per portion. Super delicious and flavorful! Then we ordered the chicken ruby, garlic naan, and steamed rice. The portions itself was perfect for two people! The food was super good, delicious and flavorful!!! YOu can taste everything in the chicken ruby! Really recommend it!"
22/6/2019,5 star rating,Very hospitable and always tries to make food best for you Great food for vegetarians Jains and vegans!
3/6/2014,5 star rating,"It's true, the best Indian food in the world (including India) is in England, and Dishoom is an example of that. Hubs and I went around 10pm on a Monday night and were seated right away, no reservations. The decor is stylish, modern, and trendy, unlike any other Indian restaurant I've been to back in California. The service was great, everyone was friendly and food came out promptly. What we ordered: Chai tea: as good as everyone says! Keema pau: sooo good. Get it! Black daahl: nothing impressive...I didn't prefer it Chicken Ruby: bursting with flavor! My favorite dish. Garlic naan: perfectly toasted and light, with clumps of fresh garlic. It came out fresh and hot. If I lived in London, I'd eat here all the time!"
21/6/2019,5 star rating,"Delicately cooked, this is possibly the best Indian cuisine I have experienced.  Recommend the ruby chicken, but really try anything!  Also, don't be intimidated by the long lines: it's worth the wait!"
24/2/2019,5 star rating,"I echo what everyone else is saying...this place is fantastic!!! Definitely go for the black daal and the chicken ruby, it was our best meal in London!! Disappointingly we didn't make it back for a second time before we had to leave. But... MAKE A RESERVATION!!"
18/6/2019,5 star rating,Recommended this pace by a good friend. Wasnt disappointed. Food was brilliant and great atmosphere. Restaurant was very busy but super organised.
2/9/2018,5 star rating,The gold standard of Indian food. Great customer service. Long line but so worth the wait. Definitely returning!
16/1/2016,5 star rating,"It was a wait of 45 mins to get in. But well worth it. Quick service, very courteous staff and the food - well - brilliant. I had the dishoom chicken tikka, the chicken biryani and chai. The chicken tikka was cooked to perfection and the spices were perfect. The bottomless chai - on a cold day - what else could you ask for. All in all - I highly recommend this place. I know for sure I am going back."
13/11/2016,5 star rating,"I have eaten around the world at some of the best restaurants, and I do not know if I have ever had a meal as flavorful as our afternoon fare at dishoom.  We visited at the recommendation of some colleagues and dishoom did not disappoint.  The decor is inviting and the food is bold.  As with any Indian cuisine, most dishes have a decent amount of spice, but I have to say that the clean heat to the dishes at Dishoom is something I rarely get with the Indian dishes I try.  The Bhel (an appetizer) is a must try.  The chicken ruby and basmati rice are both incredible.  Well done Dishoom, we will be back."
7/10/2018,5 star rating,"This place is really good. A bit of a wait at peak times, but honestly worth it. This is some of the best Indian food around. Really nice atmosphere and great staff. I highly recommend coming here."
1/10/2018,5 star rating,"Ate at dishoom over a year ago and I still think about my meal there. Amazing Indian food. Would recommend to anyone, especially those visiting London to eat here!!!!"
8/1/2018,5 star rating,"Had so many helpings of the garlic naan here. You know naan is perfect when you can eat it on its own. Please order the chai! I haven't had chai this good outside of India, ever."
6/1/2018,5 star rating,"Wow! What can I say about this incredible restaurant. From the moment you enter this vibrant, lively place you embark on an extravagant culinary journey. The food is not even close to the typical restaurant Indian food. It is in fact a fusion of Indian and British influence; a fusion of flavors. Wow! We are very fortunate that we have cooks at our homes in India and in the US, so we do not usually eat outside Indian food. When one of my wife's friends suggested Dishoom, we immediately said that we did not want to eat at a restaurant. There is something sort of sacrilegious about Indians eating outside Indian food. Please don't ask me to explain why.  That's just how it is. But Dishoom blew the doors off all of our conventional thinking. We did not expect to have such a great experience. Not only was the food delicious, but the staff was incredibly kind. Our waitress could not have been more hospitable. She explained all of the dishes as if we had never tried Indian food before in our lives. It was actually quite refreshing to hear someone describe our own native food in such an enthusiastic manner! All of the food she recommended was fabulous. I loved the Dishoom India Pale Ale beer. If you are in London, you MUST go to Dishoom!"
6/1/2015,3 star rating,"Chicken ruby - tender and heavenly. Heavenly tender. Paneer - too dry and too bland. Chai tea - nicely spiced, but could be larger. Chocolate mousse - ordinary and not worth the £5+ Pistachio kulfi - subtle and not too sweet. Like. Garlic naan - only 1 piece per person?!?"
11/7/2016,5 star rating,"Dishoom is amazing. First off, we actually went to the Kings Cross branch in Granary Square. I went once with a friend and once with a group of 11 college students. The food is amazing, and really that's all that really matters. For dinner I had the lamb awadhi biryani and its so rare to actually get a proper biryani anywhere.Roomali roti is another thing you can't get outside India very much, and their version is fantastic. But I actually really loved the breakfast. The kejriwal, chilli cheese toast with eggs was amazing. Also bun maska and chai in proper chai glasses. What more could you want? The lines do get seriously absurdly long. We arrived right at 5 and had no wait. And for breakfast since we had a group of over 6 we were able to make a reservation. It really is worth the hype."
10/6/2019,5 star rating,"The best Indian food you can get in London for the price. Very unique flavors, cocktails are pricy but worth it."
31/5/2016,4 star rating,"The food is simply delightful - full stop. Without any doubt this is the best Punjabi food I've had for a long time. I particularly liked he starters, such as lamb chops and also kebab. My partner had Tandoor chicken and loved it too. Price wise it's actually quite ok! Amazing mixture of very affordable and really tasty food so will definitely repeat."
10/7/2020,2 star rating,They took my daughters legs and dragged her on a table a put a dead rat on and made her eat cockroach legs. The food was infested with bugs.
30/12/2017,5 star rating,"Worth the wait in the freezing cold , the serve Bombay style cutting chai while you wait. Lamb chops and fried okras were excellent. Amazing match for my craving for Indian food. Friendly Staff."
5/9/2016,3 star rating,Go for breakfast its great. Bacon wrapped in nan bread smothered in ghee....I mean yes! The Indian spiced omelette yes! The free refills on chai...YES! Never go for dinner unless you like a 2 hour wait.....! needs to start taking reservations its just too busy for this turn up an queue malarky.
10/6/2016,5 star rating,"I will never get tired of coming here. Yet to find a place that's better to work in. Once you get through the epic queues (top tip: morning or late lunch work best), there's no timed limit on how long you can keep your table and the chai gets you bottomless refills. The staff are always friendly and the food is heavenly, if you're so tempted. Plus there's decent free wifi!"
16/4/2019,5 star rating,We ate at Dishoom 2 times while on a 5 day trip to London which tells you how much we enjoyed it. We went to 2 different locations and both were casual and delicious. The vegeterian and gluten free options are great and there are lots of choices! The service was very friendly and fast. I am not sure if they take reservations but we did wait over an hour for the first meal at Dishoom and the second time we almost got turned away as they were closing in 10 minutes.I would recommend timing it so you don't get shut out of this great restaurant.
7/9/2017,5 star rating,There was a wait but it was still amazing. My boyfriend and I ended up sitting at a smaller table but that was fine :) The food was so flavorful. It looked small but by the end my stomach was so full. The servers are super attentive and very kind. The wait wasn't very long either. The drink was really good. I had Thumbs Up. I definitely recommend.
27/5/2020,5 star rating,"Hard to find a way to add any higher praise to the restaurant of the decade in London. Great food, great decor, great folks running it, even great bathrooms. Its even fun waiting in the (very long) line to get in -- drinks provided, friendships established, people watched, anticipation and hunger growing. Virus go away now -- I can't wait to get back into that line!"
26/7/2016,5 star rating,"Love this place too! Have been quite a few times now! Just keep in mind Indian cuisine is insanely varied with very different style depending on the regions, Dishoom takes you to the old Irani Cafes of Bombay!! Everything about it takes you there - obviously the food and the smell but also the beautiful decor and the insane attention to detail! Staff has always been more than friendly. It's often very busy and requires queue but lovely touch as the staff offers you complimentary chai or mint tea whilst you wait. Let's start with a quick review of the breakfast menu - unfortunately for my liking breakfast menu at the weekend is only served until 11.45am... I mean seriously? That's not right! I tried to go couple times and failed! Successfully got there once at the weekend. However, I am lucky enough to work in media industry which means I have the privilege to take clients out and a Dishoom Breakfast is always a success! Love the bacon & egg naan bread - simple, basic but excellent. The Mango Lassi is to die for!! Absolutely delicious, not technically on the breakfast menu but it's not a problem for them. Before moving on to the lunch/dinner menu I do want to mention the cocktails! Oh my! Their Bombay Colada & the Edwina's affair are to die for! Amazing flavoursome twist to classics! Finally, the food... The Chicken Ruby is an absolute must. The Okra fries are genius. The sauces dishes are amazing to dip with your garlic or cheese naan! But even the less saucy dishes are cooked to perfection. Slight disappointment with the paneer roll to be honest. It was good but not extraordinary. I think it's more something to have on the go so perhaps doesn't work so well at a sit down dinner. I don't know, the flavours were there but just wasn't really working for me. Finally the puddings! That chocolate fondant with the chilli ice cream is great! Wobbles & melts in your plate and then your mouth, amazing combination with the ice cream. Otherwise you cannot go wrong with the kulfi on a stick!"
27/4/2016,5 star rating,"Oh my gosh. Food heaven. Definitely worth the queue, so don't be put off by the no booking policy! Amazing service from start to finish. They bring out chai lattes (and umbrellas if it's rainy) in the queue, then you can wait in the bar for a table. Gave us a chance to try their cocktails - the bombaylinis are divine! The main restaurant is really dynamic, an atmospheric blend of Asian decor and modern urban lighting. You can see the chefs at work, so you know everything's really fresh! It's etiquette to order a load of dishes and graze together; they had a gorgeous selection of plates, including marinated meat from the grill, curries, fish and vegetarian dishes. Beautiful lamb chops and daal, and plenty of sundries to soak it up... Got to save room for a dessert - even if it's just a pistachio kulfi (ice cream lolly)... Delicious end to an amazing meal, certainly lived up the reviews!"
3/6/2016,3 star rating,"So before I go too far with this review, and before you stop reading it (as presumably you're aghast at only 3 stars), bear with me. I hail from a part of Sydney with one of the highest concentrations of Indian population & restaurants in the country. Subsequently, I'm used to very good Indian food, from all regions of India. And when I say very good, I mean excellent. Right, now that that's out of the way... I trust Yelpers implicitly. I've had so many fantastic experiences by following Yelp reviews wherever I travel. Subsequently, I'm a little curious as to how high a rating Dishoom got. Don't get me wrong - it was all good. There was nothing bad about the meal I had. It's just that there was nothing stunning about the food I had. Maybe my expectations were too high as I had to wait almost an hour to get in. Maybe I'm just used to a different style of Indian food (maybe the food in Sydney was adjusted to local tastes?). Maybe I just got there on a not so good night? Or maybe my taste buds were just off?... Regardless, if you're after a good feed, this place will give it to you. It was definitely satisfying. But then, balancing that with the price and the wait, maybe there's somewhere else you could go, for better food, less coin, and less of a wait?"
17/6/2017,5 star rating,"This place is really popular. I always see a huge line outside at night time. At least 1 hour wait. They only receive reservations for the day time and walk in only for the night time. I made a reservation for Sunday afternoon. At around 3:45, there's already a line outside. They give you three sauces to dip: spicy, sweet and herbal. They both taste good by themselves. I tried the keema pau. The minced lamb with peas and the toasted buns are good. They really go well together. The children ruby is the best. Usually I like the Indian chicken dishes because of the sauce and not the chicken. Here the chicken really absorbs the sauce and tastes a lot better than the sauce. I also ordered the garlic naan. Even though they say it's made by hand and baked to order, it's good but not the best I've had. The service is good and the waitress gave me good recommendations."
1/12/2017,2 star rating,"Cool design ,food below average much better Indian food available in london ,none of the dishes tasted fresh ,probably Pre cooked in bulk to cater To the long lines,I really cannot understand what the fuss is all about extremly average food go for ambience only"
26/2/2015,5 star rating,"Saturday night, we waited 2 hours to be seated but it was 100% worth it. The service is superb and the hostess would bring out drinks while we waited outside. Then you could be seated/ stand around the bar when space opened up and order some appetizers. We started with okra fries and samosas. The okra fries were addictive and wonderful - and I hate okra. For dinner, we opted to share a bunch of plates. We got the lentils, ruby chicken, and keema pau. The keema pau was superb. It was all extremely delicious and perfect portions. Rice or bread is a separate order. Indian food in London is a must and Dishoom is the place to go."
9/7/2018,5 star rating,"Best Indian food I've ever had! Ruby chicken and black daal were excellent, as was the garlic nan. So glad I checked Yelp for recommendations. This restaurant is super popular for good reason. Best to get a reservation or eat early, like we did"
26/6/2019,5 star rating,Worth the wait.   Very good.  Wait staff was wonderful.   Okra fries and hot sauce was a favorite.
9/10/2016,4 star rating,"I came to Dishoom on a Saturday night with three friends. This place is crazy busy, and they like to keep a line outside, so we joined the queue and waited. I think we were there by 7:15 or so, and got a table a bit before 9. Most of the wait was outside, until we finally made it into the bar. We ordered some cocktails, which were delicious. The pimms is actually too good, and was too easy to drink so we eventually switched to wine. As we were 4, we decided to order a number of dishes to share. My friends got a few meat dishes (lamb chops, one coconut prawn curry, something with chicken) and we also shared dahl and a paneer curry, as well as rice, cheese naan, and some side salad-y cabbage-y dishes. Everything tasted really good, although it wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had. The portions were quite generous I thought, and by the end of the meal I was so full I could barely move. The service here was amazing- all of the staff were friendly, we never felt rushed (even though by 10:30 there was still a huge lineup outside), and our food came quite quickly, which was very welcome after having stood outside for ages. The ambiance is also great, especially when with a fun group. I don't know that I'd come here for a date, or just a one-on-one dinner as it's quite busy and loud, but with our group we had a great time. I really enjoyed my evening here, but I don't think I would line up again for over an hour. The entire experience was great, but the food isn't worth a huge wait."
9/5/2016,5 star rating,"Amazing breakfast. Typically friendly service delivered by charming young staff. Get the chicken ruby and an old fashioned at dinner time and it won't disappoint. Bacon naan roll is a tasty treat and the coffee is magic. It ain't cheap, but value for money-wise it's hard to beat."
25/1/2019,5 star rating,"Excellent food! Great vibe! Good drinks! Been here on three occasions, once by myself, once with a large group (20+), and once with my husband. On none of these occasions, did I have to wait for a table. Not sure I would have enjoyed the food as much if I did."
29/4/2014,3 star rating,"This was highly rated both on Yelp and Trip Adviser. When we arrived there was a line outside the restaurant. It was a bustling Saturday dinner crowd. The workers are very nice, we waited about 20 min and they ushered us in to the downstairs bar area to wait outside the cold. They also served some warm chai while we were waiting in line. On to the food. Most everything was pretty good, although portions a little on the small side. We had to order two extra dishes to be satisfied. For starters we got the calamari and fried okra. The fried okra was very good, not too slimy with a nice crunch. Calamari was OK, it had a slightly sweet taste which I didn't care for. My favorite was the chicken ruby (not sure of the name). It's the only chicken curry on the menu. Flavorful with moist chicken chunks. We also got two of the grilled chicken dishes and the spicy lamb chops. The lamb had a good kick of flavor and not gamey, however for the price you only get three little chops. The one thing I did not like was the must touted black dal. It tasted like re fried beans. Same texture and almost same flavor but with an Indian spice kick. Overall it was a good experience, the service was nice and food in general was good."
29/3/2016,5 star rating,"Look here's the thing. Normally Indian food is not my Jam under any circumstances. And yet here I am giving an Indian restaurant 5 stars so it's not just a good Indian restaurant it's an amazing one, one that can make me forget what my overtly racist taste buds want me to eat. I went ham with the ordering so here's what we got: Vegetable Somosas- started off with a classic and it was a great start. Very standard no doubt but seasoned very well and fried perfectly. No complaints but also no unique twist on it. Pau Bhaji- now things are getting interesting- ""a bowl of mashed vegetables"" is the description; what an understatement. Basically a vegetable tomato paste that was flat out delicious and the perfect dip for bread. Okra Fries- and now we hit the jackpot. Fried okra that I swear was seasoned so much you would think it would be way too much but it worked perfectly. A punch of flavor in your mouth for sure, but an amazing one. Awadhi Lamb- extremely tender and flavorful. Sauced like crazy but I wanted much more. Garlic Naan- I mean it's Naan and bread is always gonna be delicious. PSA- Ordered a second helping of Okra fries-they were that good. It's on the lists of best restaurants in London and for good reason. The lines can be brutal but either show up away from peak hours or suck it up because those okra fries are worth every second waiting in that cold raining nightmare of a city :D"
18/4/2016,5 star rating,"There's no way around it: Dishoom is a ""thing"". If you go in the morning, you get a tasty ""breakfast thing"". If you go for lunch, you get ""a delectable, cacophonous lunch thing."" And if you go for dinner, you get ""a stand in line for an hour in drizzle thing"". For Dishoom is well past discovered and isn't likely to return to ambiguity in any forseeable future. So, you're gonna have to deal with ""the thing"". It is worth it? Absolutely. I've been here over a dozen times and have never been disappointed. From the Gunpowder Potatoes with lime zest, to Okra Fries, to any of the curries...Dishoom is amaze-balls. The environs are well-appointed. Kind of a ""dark wood and eclectic trappings from the East India Company thing"". The waitstaff is prompt, high professional, and handles the chaos with aplomb. The prices are a tad on the high-side for curry, but reasonable. The beer - several of which are made expressly for Dishoom - is YUM. So the only thing is ""the thing"". You're gonna have to deal with the wait, and crowds, and noise. Or are you? In the years I've been going to Dishoom it's added three more locations. I haven't been to all of them, but I can tell you ones I have been to are way less crowded than St. Martin's Lane. So go have a night in any of the others, and leave the chaos for those not in the know. You'll have a spectacular thing."
5/9/2018,1 star rating,"Went to check out what the hype was about! It was a Monday evening n we reached the place at 7 pm.. there was a long queue and these guys don't take reservations. We were told the wait time is an hour and 20 mins! Stood in the queue n were finally ushered in. We got a table in the noisy basement. It was already too crowded n too loud. For the next 10 mins, 3 servers came around n asked if we want water, but no one served it until we placed the order n requested again for water. The service could be much better for the price. Please start taking reservations when you know it gets busy."
31/3/2019,5 star rating,Very good as everyone says. Long queue so if you know at least a week out what time you'd like to dine and you're a party under 6 and can begin your meal before 5:45 - reservations will make your experience VIP as you cruise past the line. Very good Indian - the spices not as layered as you'll get in India but priced well and the experience is really a delight. Watch the kitchen creating your naan Suggested add ons are not all necessary so don't agree unless you really like the recommendation. Tandoori chicken is a must.
12/10/2019,5 star rating,First time eating Indian food and it was great. The drinks and their chai tea were wonderful. Excellent service.
30/3/2017,5 star rating,"Fantastic and worth the wait. Without a reservation, my party of 2 had to wait about 40 minutes in the queue .The hostess, security, and managerial staff were all very gracious, offering us warm chai as we waited. After about 30 minutes, we were able to go to the bar and wait for our table, which was ready with in minutes of us getting our cocktails (Viceroy old fashioned  and chaijito ). Then came the food: calamari, bowl of greens, lamb samosas, chicken tikka, and prawn curry. Ohmuhgerditssoogood. Savory, sweet and with lots of heat. Everything was delicious, including dessert (the decadent chocolate pudding is a must have). TLDR: Nomnomnom. Eat all the delicious things."
22/3/2016,5 star rating,"I dream about Dishoom and bee line for it for lunch or brunch when I land back home in London, a truly delicious British Indian restaurant with cool interior design and crazy low prices for the quality of food. Normally I grab a bacon naan roll (it makes me so very happy that's a thing!) and go from there but it was lunch time so this time we started with the far far (spicy chips (described as a 'sort of festival of snackery' - sold!) and chilly cheese on toast followed by black daal, lamb kabob, chicken berry biriyani and roti - and then a mebsahibs mess - so a light lunch for two... And waddled out not too much poorer but very much fuller two hours later. Delightful service from Leo throughout. You can't book here and waits can be a while if you come at peak eating times - but come very late morning for an early lunch or mid afternoon for a late one and you'll stroll right in. It's a staple on my London home-eating circuit. And the hundreds of good reviews are entirely deserved. They also have locations in soho and shoreditch if Covent Garden tourist crowds make you want to die!"
4/5/2016,5 star rating,"I absolutely love Dishoom! That's as good as intro I'll ever write.. Brunch is obviously my favourite (I'm a brunchaholic) Have the egg + bacon naan and the scrambled eggs are also to die for! In terms of other food, I love the Chicken Ruby and the squid. And if I could make those gunpowder potatoes every day I would! Also - that watermelon mocktail is as good as a drink without alcohol can get ;)"
21/10/2018,5 star rating,"If you had told me I would wait in line for an hour and a half on the street to get in the door, I would have said you were crazy! I had a quick bite for lunch during the week, and enjoyed it so much my wife wanted to try it as well. Saturday night there was a two hour queue, and we were told it was no shorter at their other establishments in the city! It ended up being a social experience, talking to others in line, so the time went by quickly. Probably better with a group. The food was indeed fantastic, which explains the popularity. The chicken tikka was so well seasoned that every bite was precious. Also enjoyed the ruby chicken curry, calamari appetizer and the nan. Plenty of tasty things on the menu, all very creatively prepared. Definitely a cut above some of the other more traditional Indian restaurants we tried while in London. You can make reservations on line 24 hours ahead if you're pressed for time."
7/7/2016,4 star rating,"Great food! great atmosphere! what more could you ask for?! based in several locations around London! make sure to find and try one by you! WARNING: you can not book, so if its a cold day ques could have you waiting outside! so wrap up warm!"
25/5/2017,5 star rating,"Loved getting a cup of chia while waiting on line. What a treat. Once inside we ordered a few appetizers: paneer, chaat, keema, and Bellini's. The food was delish and just the right portions."
6/8/2017,5 star rating,"We came here for a quick lunch before an event in Covent Garden. Make sure to make a reservation, as this place is extremely popular! The ambiance is like stepping into an authentic Indian kitchen, with a view of chefs making naan and the scent of exotic spices wafting through the air. We started off our lunch with the flavorful Far Far (or as it's referred to in the menu, a ""carnival of snackery""). We also had the gunpowder potatoes, chicken tikka, and a chicken tikka roll, all of which were delicious!"
25/3/2016,5 star rating,"I wasn't sure the first time, or the 2nd time I went to Dishoom, but the 3rd time was the decider. This place deserves 5 stars. There isn't a dish I have tired in 3 visits, that was bad, all of them fresh, tasty, and the perfect mix of items on the menu. One of my favourite things, is the smell when you walk into the restaurant. The smell of Indian spices instantly hitting you, and instantly making you hungry! The suggestion here is simple, get loads of starters and small plates to share, and then go for a main. Some of my favourites are- Lamb Samosa Chilli cheese toast Vada Pau Calamari Chicken Tikka Masala Prawns Stick some Nann bread on, a portion or rice and you are well on your way. Controversial dessert-the Kulfi on a stick-bascially an ice lolly/ice cream, but its a great finish to the meal and a bit different! There is no point in writing any more, Dishoom is a must, you will have heard of it, people will recommend it and it's well worth a visit! Writing about it is making me crave it again!"
20/5/2015,5 star rating,Dishoom is excellent! My husband and I decided to try this place after searching for nearby Indian restaurants and I'm so glad we did. We walked in and got a table right away (we got there about 5:30pm on a Tuesday though). The decor of the restaurant was very cool. Our waitress was amazing. She was very helpful with the menu. They even have a color coated dairy free menu to help make decisions if you have any food allergies or preferences. The food was so good! We enjoyed every bit of it and the price was good too. We spend 30£ total and were both perfectly full. I definitely recommend checking this place out.
30/4/2018,2 star rating,"When we searched ""Best Indian food in London"" on Yelp, Dishoom seemed like a no-brainer since it boasted over 1000 five star reviews. After learning the wait time for a table was over an hour and a half, we thought ""If people are willing to wait over an hour and a half for a meal, this food must be outta this world! No one would be stupid enough to waste almost 2 hours of their life standing in line for mediocre food!"" We debated whether we should stay or go, but the curiosity of why anyone would wait so long for a meal got the better of us and we decided to wait it out. There were several hostesses who put your name on the waitlist and bring you hot chai while you stand in the cold London streets. Exactly 1h30m later we were ushered inside. The restaurant was simply decorated, elegant, classy, but simple. I was surprised at what a well oiled machine it all seemed. I must have counted at least 5 hosts/hostesses (at least)! Over 20 servers, and hundreds of guests. We were guided downstairs where the ambiance wasn't as pretty, and after 1h30m of waiting we were seated by the staircase (where guests came in and out of), not the best start. My expectations are now really high given that I agreed to wait so long. We ordered a spicy shrimp dish with tamarind sauce, the paneer tika masala, naan, and the jackfruit biryani. The spicy shrimp dish, though a tad bit over salted, tasted delicious, and the sweet tangyness of the tamarind chutney made it a really flavorful dish. Unfortunately all the other dishes we ordered were underwhelming. The paneer tika lacked spices, it was flavorless, and other than the fact that we were eating cheese --- cause who doesn't love cheese, it wasn't very special at all, and it was even a little dry. The naan was neither bad nor good. It was just your every day naan that you can get anywhere (without having to wait over 2hrs for it). But worst of all was the Biryani. It was overpriced dry and flavorless rice, with very scarce pieces of equally flavorless jackfruit. The service was also all over the place. Although the host staff was friendly, our waitress was flustered and barely came to our table, we had to ask for water several times before it was brought to us. Lastly they boast to offer ""unlimited chai"" but when you're paying almost $5 per chai, it BETTER be unlimited refills. Under normal circumstances (meaning, if I hadn't had to wait in line for 1h30m, and then another 30m to get our food), I would given Dishoom 3 stars. Had the food been exceptional, I would have had NO hesitation rating it 5 stars, however, due to the mediocrity of it all, add the extensive waiting period, i would argue that 2 stars is a fair rating. As we were seated at our table, we heard many Americans chatting at several tables nearby and we realized Dishoom is more of a hyped up tourist trap than a legit establishment for fine Indian fare. I encourage folks to read The Guardian review of Dishoom (by Jay Rayner) before waiting 2hrs for an overpriced Indian meal. If you want to stand in line, then go ahead! But we'll be opting for a place in Southall with better food and no wait!"
11/10/2014,3 star rating,"The wait times are ridiculous. You can hang out in the bar downstairs while you wait and grab some snacks but you can't get a full menu down there, though some dining tables are downstairs (you still have to wait all the same). Lots of interesting stuff to try and delicious Chai while you stand in line."
10/2/2016,5 star rating,"One of my favourite restaurants in London. The place is always crowded so I recommend making reservations especially to sit outside they have a lovely garden. I've been there before and after going vegan and I was never disappointed by it. Now my favourites are the potato, okra fries, the bowl of greens ( ohh wow! ), puff rice and a chickpea with rice plate which I don't know the name but I will sure up date it soon as I remember it. Dishroom is a perfect place to go for a date or take your family and friends on a special dinner and it's also fun! I love the idea of having small plates and sharing the food. I have been there many times now and I will be back soon for sure."
8/6/2019,5 star rating,Ohhhhhh daddy! FEED ME MORE! Chicken Tikka yes please!!!!!! Everything on the menu is great!
3/5/2016,4 star rating,"Great ambiance, average food & great service. I appreciate the modern Indian & Persian small plates but flavors were bland, which probably is how british prefer. They have a nice bar, worth the try"
15/3/2019,5 star rating,"Some of the best Indian food I have ever had. When we first arrived, we were told the wait would be an hour for two people on a Sunday afternoon. The wait ended up being much shorter than that, and we were given tea and mint water while standing in the queue. Once seated, service was prompt, and our food and drinks arrived fairly quickly in spite of how busy the restaurant was. We ordered the cheesy naan, chicken tikka, lamb biryani, and the keema pao. All were delicious! We will definitely visit this restaurant the next time we are in London."
18/11/2018,5 star rating,"AMAZING! My husband and I came here during our honeymoon. It was one of the highlights! We had to wait for about an hour, but the staff offered us free samples of their drinks and allowed us (and other guests waiting) to sit in their bar. There was seating in the bar and several people ordered drinks while they waited. It was a nice place to meet other tourists/locals. When we were seated our serve was wonderful! He walked us through the menu and suggested dishes. The food was outstanding and we cannot wait to go back during our next trip to London. Thank you for this special experience!"
14/3/2016,4 star rating,"This restaurant is impressive, from the decor to the desserts. Don't come here to enjoy just one dish, come to share many dishes amongst friends and make sure your try their cocktails. Each restaurant has its own house special - the black lentil dahl in the Covent Garden branch is just delicious. I've frequented it plenty of times, there's so many dishes to choose from and they even do the salads well. A hearty, wholesome and incredibly delicious and fresh option for indian cuisine, I've never been disappointed and usually find myself too full to finish what I've ordered in my sheer excitement over the menu (but that's nothing new) I haven't been before dinner service, but I hear breakfast and brunch is done exceedingly well here and the restaurant works well for any social setting; a date, a relaxed social with friends and on a business level. Remember - sharing is caring (& you can order that little bit more!) C.x"
11/10/2018,1 star rating,Called for a reservation a week ago for 9 tonight and got turned away unless I could wait another hour...
7/1/2017,5 star rating,"Excellent food, the breakfast is particularly interesting. Try the naan with eggs. The house chai is their ""specialty"" but the cappuccino is also great. Can't go wrong here other than the long wait if you don't have a reservation!"
1/6/2018,1 star rating,Totally overhyped. It was not worth the hour wait outside the restaurant. It was not very flavorful and was not traditional. You would think for a country that once claimed India as a colony they would at least be able to represent the food better. The place I go to in the states in much cheaper and much more flavorful than this place. Don't waste your time in line.
8/3/2016,5 star rating,A game-changer for budget franchises...it feels so much more expensive than it really is. Went for breakfast- tried the bacon naan roll everyone raves about and I've jumped on the bandwagon. I could eat 3 portions.  Not sure if it's a normal thing but my waitress handed me a free cup of hot chai tea and it was deeeeeeelicious. Can't wait to go for dinner.
25/2/2014,5 star rating,"I wish Dishoom would open up a restaurant in Chicago, because I freakin love this place!  I got there on a Saturday around noon and didn't have to wait at all.  I love breakfast and they didn't disappoint one bit. Their Bacon Naan Roll and House Chai combo is probably one of my favorite breakfasts, after having it just once.  Easily the best Chai I've ever had and wish I had some right now.  I loved the Bacon Naan Roll and how could you not?  Yout get some  back bacon, chili tomato jam, cream cheese, and some herbs, all rolled up in some freshly baked naan.  It's the perfect combination of salty, sweet, and naan. If you have trouble finding the place, you can't miss the colorful bicycles out front."
17/6/2016,4 star rating,"I don't normally like indian food as my experience has generally been a let down. Dishoom is the only exception i'll make as it has yummy mix of options, great for sharing. Not that keen on the desserts though."
27/11/2016,5 star rating,"I'm not a huge Indian food fan but thought I'd trust the perpetual line outside of this place and I'm so glad I did. Amazing food and service and the price point was pretty good too. Here is what we ordered: -Okra Fries -Naan -Black Daal (Amazing curry) -Gunpowder Potatoes -Lamb Roti (Spicy, good but not great) -Bowl of Greens -Far Far Expect a long wait (we were quoted an hour which is a short quote from what I hear but we came later - around 9:15pm) and they were actually able to get us in in 30 minutes. In line, the hosts came by to offer choice of complimentary tea or Sherry which was appreciated!"
7/6/2016,3 star rating,"When it comes to eating out i tend not to go for South Asian cuisine, reason being - My maa makes it better. Anyway after all of the hype i went to Dishoom and i have to say i was not disappointed. However i would like to recommend this restaurant more for lunch and snack like cuisine. I had the Samosa Chaat and Vada Pau both were perfect and i would have these again. For main course I had Chicken Biryani and i have to say thats where my disappointment came from as it was not as rich as i had wanted it to be. Nevertheless its off my list of places to check out and i would not mind visitng again."
29/5/2014,3 star rating,"This is a very busy Indian restaurant that has efficiently streamlined their waiting-customer process. When I arrived on a weekend around 7PM (peak hour), there was a wait that they said would take 45 minutes. I decided to wait (table for 2) and they gave me one of those buzzers. I waited for 10 minutes and one of the hosts said there was room for me at the bar downstairs. I happily went down to the bar and sat down for another 10 minutes until the buzzer rang. Since I'm from the US and didn't have any cellular phone service, I was happy to use their free wifi (no password needed). If you're coming here in a group, do your best to make a reservation. Our server was attentive and the food was good. I'd say that this is one of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to (not just in the UK) based on food quality and atmosphere. You feel like you should be dressed up (at least business casual) at this joint. I don't remember everything we ordered, but it included the house black daal (must-order), a chicken dish, garlic naan, roti, and mango lassi. Everything was pretty delicious and I don't think you can go wrong with whatever appeals to you on the menu. The only drawback about this place is the price. I guess they're popular enough to demand the amount they charge, but dang it costs like $6 USD for one piece of naan. If the naan wasn't so expensive I would for sure give this place 4 stars. Each person who wants naan/roti should get their own order because 1 order will not be enough for more than 1 person. So, I'm happy I tried some Indian food in London (since there's a large population) and this would be the place I recommend for fancy, quality Bombay food."
16/5/2016,3 star rating,"We came here as the reviews were good ... It did mention the wait but it fail to say it was not worth it . First, get ready for an unnecessary hour wait outside, the food is as good as any other Indian restaurant you will find in London, the wait do not warrant the quality of the food, we try quite a nice array The fried squid - it's oily no crispy The lamb Samoa - dry and tasteless The spicy lamb chops - dry, over cook The garlic nam - was good The rice - basic steam rice The ruby Ryan - the star of the chef - ummm is ok nothing to brag about - chicken was little tough due to the long simmer Not against going as the staff is really friendly but not worth the wait ... The long line It's a marketing strategic to lore costumers in , by the way after waiting outside you get to wait at the bar as well before you get a table . Happy eating !!!"
16/6/2017,5 star rating,"Awesome place, plenty of vegetarian options which is nice. The staff are on point and friendly. The full breakfast is the jam, and the omelette looks fantastic. I'll be back for surr"
17/9/2017,5 star rating,"Incredible! Long wait times are always a pain, but you know it is going to be good! Definitely worth the wait and once you're inside the bar can keep you busy! The food and service is amazing, I especially love the biryani. It may not be like the typical family run Indian restaurants in London but it is definitely a great change and the food quality is perfection."
4/10/2014,5 star rating,"Amazing breakfast as usual at Dishoom today. I had the Chai tea, which was spicy, hot and never-ending --perfect for the cold, rainy morning it was. To eat I chose Keema Per Eedu, which was superb. The pau were delicious. My companions chose the Bombay Omellete and Bacon and Egg Naan Roll, and it was three very happy, full people that left the restaurant. As a side note, I love the way this place is decorated! The lighting fixtures are gorgeous, the pictures on the wall endearing and amusing, and the bathrooms always lovely."
18/1/2020,5 star rating,"Lived up to the reviews. So amazing from service go food! Even standing in line was fine. We just nice people, and drank some tea. A good!"
25/4/2016,4 star rating,"We visited Dishoom in Shoreditch shortly after a few games of ping pong in nearby Bounce. The two make for a great combination! Although the entrance to the restaurant is situated on a Shoreditch backstreet, the decorative interior and ambience makes it feel like you're stepping into a different world. The lights are dimmed, giving a dark and moody atmosphere, even during late afternoon. But not in a gothic way - it has the persona of an imperial Bombay cafe.  There is an outdoor terrace for the warmer summer evenings - however it is not possible to request a booking here - and the centre of the restaurant has a wide open square space fronted by the bar. The service was excellent and the food was creative and delicate at a reasonable price. The menu allows you to order small plates or a main meal. The grilled lamb kebab and chicken ruby tasted amazing and there was a choice of Indian beers and IPAs. As can be expected for a restaurant such as this, there was a 40 minute wait for a table. Dishoom keeps back most of their tables for walk-ins. But at least there wasn't a queue halfway down the street - Dishoom allows you to sit at the bar with an electronic bleeper that lets you know when your table is ready. Would definitely visit again and try some more dishes."
12/11/2017,5 star rating,"This was by far one of the best meals I have ever had! Drinks and appetizers were fantastic, and just enough to munch on, but not too much that I was not hungry when I got my meal. The chicken tikka, with aromatic rice and garlic naan had a great flavor without the garlic being too overpowering. We had a wonderful serve who answered all of our questions on the menu and gave us great sight seeing recommendations throughout the city. We were tempted to go back for the rest of our meals in London. Would definitely recommend getting there early as it is incredibly busy, but a wonderful place to spend an evening."
5/9/2015,4 star rating,So authentic! Went for lunch. Possibly one of the best chicken salads I've had! The bottomless chai goes down a treat. Excellent.
1/12/2014,4 star rating,"The food is really good!  Why the 4 stars instead of 5?? The line was insanely long.  55 minutes long. what irked me the most: 35-40 min into the wait, I see a table clear up.  Fine, I didn't think it was going to go to me anyway.  They tell me to go downstairs to the bar and have a drink b/c it looks like it'll be another 20 minutes.  Fine, I oblige.   I order drinks and they tell me my table is ready.  Low and behold it was the table that freed up and sat empty for 15-20 minutes while they get me to order drinks at the bar. Whatever That aside, the food was delicious.   When it is labeled SPICY, they are serious! The chicken tikka set my mouth on fire."
8/10/2016,5 star rating,"By far the best Indian food I've eve had! Despite the long wait, they make it the best possible experience for you while waiting. Only problem is they require you to wait in line the entire time. You can't leave and come back after putting your name down. We were quoted an hour and a half wait but made it in after an hour. While you wait in line they provide you drinks outside! Everything we ordered was fantastic. The okra fries were well seasoned and really crunchy. I'm not a fan of okra but these changed my mind. We also ordered the lamb chops , garlic naan, prawn Moilee   And phau  bhaji. Enjoyed every dish equally. Make sure to come here!!!"
11/7/2018,5 star rating,"Excellent! Everything: food, service, and ambiance. All of the reviews were spot on, can't really add anything additional except: don't pass this up! Line moves quick!!!"
5/1/2016,5 star rating,"Everything about this place is a resounding yes, from the moment we started lining up out front to the last bite of dessert. We arrived at 6pm and there was already a 1hr wait. However this was overestimated for us since a few tables before us left.  The wait starts outside where we were served water and house chai as we waited in line.  After 25min, we were given a buzzer and was told we could continue our wait at the bar downstairs.  I ordered a mango Lassi as we waited another 15 for our table.  Highly recommend the mango lassi. Once we sat down, we ordered the pau bhaji for apps; black house daal, ruby chicken, chicken biryani, and Naan for entrees; and finished with the pistachio kulfi and gola ice for dessert.   Pau Bhaji - seasoned mashed veggies with two buttered buns.  I know what you're thinking, that mashed veggies sound a lot like gerber's baby food, but this was on a whole nother spectrum.  It's all spiced up and tastes like dense curry that's spreadable on the buns.  Delicious - it reminds me of the the street food of Mumbai, except I wasn't afraid of getting food poisoning this time around. Ruby Chicken -  think chicken tikki masala or murgh makhani, it's the red based curry with grilled chicken chunks.  Everyone raves about this dish and for good reason, it was the clear winner of our table too; silky smooth sauce with perfectly tender chicken.  I wish we ordered this twice. Black House Daal - lentils and/or beans that are boiled overnight, it's a cream like dish with soft lentils/beans (although I think Dishoom only used lentils).  We could have skipped this.  I was lured in by other reviews, but for us, it tasted like beans cooked in butter and we wished we ordered something else. Chicken Biryani - seasoned rice dish that is normally cooked in a clay pot, it's like the fried rice of Indian food.  We loved this dish as well, the chicken was succulent and the we didn't have to order a side rice since there was plenty in this dish.  We dipped the chicken in our remaining ruby sauce and ate the rice with our other plates. Pistachio Kulfi - creamy frozen yogurt that is magical.  Leave room for one of these! Kala Khatta Gola Ice - this is a really bizarre frozen ice dessert.  It's a snowcone with the weirdest syrup you'll ever have.  I really enjoyed it because it reminds me of salted plum drinks my mom used to make me, so if that doesn't sound appetizing, I would avoid it.  My fiancee thought it was WAY too salty, but I grew up with the flavors and highly enjoyed it.   It's salty, sour, tangy, and peppery.   Overall we are incredibly satisfied we made this our Indian place to go to in London.  The wait was worth it!"
10/1/2020,5 star rating,"Amazing Indian food, made the way that it brings back such fond memories from India !! Long wait? Don't despair but keep calm and wait on. You wont be disappointed."
12/7/2016,5 star rating,"Wow, what an awesome restaurant that completely lived up the hype. I heard about this place from some locals that recommended the Indian fusion food here. As an Indian person I was skeptical, but I'm so happy I went. The food was delicious, with some really unique twists such as blueberry biryani, and overall we really enjoyed our meal. One of the best parts was the plates, each of which are unique with the story of an immigrant from South Asia and their perspective on living in London in the 20th century. Very cool!"
8/12/2018,5 star rating,"Awesome food, be prepared for a wait after the theatres let out.  I had the Roomali Roti with their Ruby Chicken and Black Daal.  The daal had nice spice and the chicken was excellent.  I will come back."
29/7/2019,5 star rating,"Friday night and no reservation made: of course, it took two hours of waiting in line for a group of five people. Fortunately, it was not raining. It was definitely worth it! Every dish was absolutely delicious! And this is considering that none of us had any experience with the authentic Indian food. We plan to come back, but looks like we need to make a reservation at least three days in advance."
14/11/2018,5 star rating,Very awesome authentic Indian place. Packed with a line outside at 10 pm. Line moved quickly and it was worth it. Indian family from London recommended and it did not disappoint.
13/4/2016,4 star rating,"If you think you know Indian food, try Dishoom. A fun take on the old colonial India with known dishes and old takes on traditional Indian fare. The interior of the Shoreditch branch was wonderful. Black lentils are a must. Not tried brunch yet, but heard it's a highlight."
22/3/2016,3 star rating,"After hearing so much about this place I finally checked it out. Overall I felt that this place was just average and didn't really live up to the hype. There were definitely positives and negatives and because I have such mixed feelings it will be easier to just list the pros and cons. Positives: - Like the decor and atmosphere (they were playing nice 1920s music which gave it that speak easy feel) - Friendly staff -  Chilli cheese toast - really good - Lamb Biriyani - tasty, tender and well cooked lamb Negatives: - Tables were very close together (like they were trying to cram in as many people in there as they could) - Chicken Tikka roll - really salty chicken and very odd flavours (super sweet, then a spicy kick, too overpowering taste of ginger), just really didn't taste nice (especially the chicken) - The ""raita"" (this was just all wrong, no cumin, it had onions and tomatoes and lacked flavour big time), it was like a salsa that someone added yoghurt to, it was also such a huge portion (like a bowl full) - ordering process (we ordered the starters and only took the mains order while we were partway through eating the mains - a bit odd) - Lack of choice (only 2 curry options - chicken or paneer and not many starters) - You can't book a table for dinner (from 5:45) for less than 6 people So to summarise, would I come here again? Maybe (I would like to try the curry) but I'm not in any rush. Is it worth it to come here when you see massive queues outside? Hell no! (On principal, I never queue for restaurants anyway, but the food is definitely not worth queuing for)."
19/9/2018,5 star rating,Really great find.  Had been here years ago and took my husband there when we visited London. We both loved it.
12/10/2018,1 star rating,Very disappointing ordinary food. There are so many great Indians in london this doesn't hold a candle to most .
8/5/2016,2 star rating,This place does not deserve the ratings displayed by other patrons. I am a globe trotter with a very eclectic palate and have tasted Indian food all over the world. I did not mind the 1 hour wait and in fact appreciated the warm tea they served outside. The only reason I come to an Indian restaurant is to enjoy some good desi food. This place is a huge disappointment! They need to change their chef or teach him how to cook Chicken Tikka Masala(Ruby). It tasted of uncooked tomatoes and the spices were not throughly cooked.The next dish we tried was a biryani and God help us.  It only made me miss the countless other decent biryanis I have had in my life time. I think the hype is initial and will die down once the audience finds out other better options!
20/11/2015,5 star rating,"There aren't many times when you wake-up (in London), stretch, call your local friend about where to go for breakfast and they say - ""How about this Indian joint?"" Huh? Yeah, my thoughts exactly! I'm all for Lamb Vindaloo kicked up to to a level 10 on the Indian spice scale or a Naan dredged in Butter chicken sauce so deep that you can't tell where the BC begins and the Naan ends! But before 11am? I danno guys... And then there was Dishoom, Sweet merciful gods of Indian cuisine, what the WHAT! So basically, the geniuses in the kitchen here have taken traditional english breakfast faves, slapped it upside the bread with some Indian spice, and boom - everything is nice. End of story. I didn't think this would be possible, call me a doubting Thomas, but I needed proof, and safe to say I got some. To begin, I opted out of my normal breakfast coffee for a House Chai (or 4) @ £2.50, I was gulping this stuff by the gallon and better than tea, better than coffee, better than freshly squeezed OJ, this made my stomach oh so happy and calm after a few days of adjusting to British fare and a long flight. Following my chai time, I didn't give my stomach too much of a break and went with the Kejriwal which is two fried eggs on chilli cheese toast. As described in the menu as ""A favourite of the well-to-do Willingdon Club, the first such Bombay institution to admit natives; the dish is reputedly named for the member who kept asking for it. (Not to be confused with Arvind Kejriwal, leader of India's Aam Aadmi - common man's - political party.)"" - £4.90 History lesson aside, this was a beautifully flavourful meal, part normal breakfast that I'm used to and part ""kick-it up a notch, Indian HELLO"" (waves excitedly). I was so impressed, and breakfast is a hard meal to impress me with - rest assured I'll be back when I'm in the UK again! Pro-tip: The Breakkie/Brunch crowd starts to queue up around 10/10:30am so make a reso or get there early Eatcrest Out!"
24/3/2019,3 star rating,"I'll give 3 stars for the atmosphere & the delicious Okra Fries. We tried the vegan menu, which was nice but would have done with some more spice/taste. I tried the House Black Daal -- and maybe my expectations were too high -- but the dish was a let-down. It lacked proper deep taste and was instead very salty. The tea was lovely and the decor great. Service good too."
31/7/2017,4 star rating,"Awesome !! It's very crowded so please reserve your table beforehand. We ordered berry chicken, kheema pao, fry okra apart from other things. For the price the quantity is very less. Overall ambience and experience is good but I was not too happy with the size of servings."
26/3/2016,5 star rating,"absolutely cannot fault it. It's so good, i go there regularly (we're talking once a month, at least). they have a wonderful variety of the most delicious dished. I would very highly recommend the black house dhal. it's so good, i want to put my face in it. the fish is very nice too. house chai is a winner - and if you're after a dessert, go for the pineapple crumble but swap the custard for cinnamon and/or chilli ice cream. you will not regret it"
30/7/2016,5 star rating,"I ate at Dishoom my first night in London. For some reason I'd been under the impression food in the UK wouldn't be very good, but Dishoom took that notion and threw it out the window. Firstly: don't be scared by the line. It moves quickly, and according to my London friend who has come here before, they grossly overestimate the time you'll spend queuing up to get in to the restaurant. Plus, they give you free fizzy lemonade while you wait. The food is exceptional and the service is quite good, too. We got a variety of plates: crispy, spicy okra fries (how have I not had these before?!), yummy garlic naan, tangy chicken tikka, paneer tikka, and the perfectly dressed bowl of greens. You know a restaurant is good when you're savoring every bite of the simply dressed greens. Anyhow, between two ladies, we thought we might have enough food to bring home for leftovers, but after a taxing day of tourist-ing, we happily ate everything in front of us. Consequently, my recommendation is to get a whole bunch of plates and share the food among your party. You'll want to sample everything you see, anyway! I got the salted caramel khulfee for dessert, which is basically like a salted caramel ice cream pop. It was yummy, and I didn't share it. Come here! I wish we had Indian food this good and inexpensive where I live."
26/4/2019,5 star rating,"Really tasty food, we were seated pretty quickly. If not there is a waiting area inside with a bar. We didn't have to wait that long. It is a very popular restaurant but the staff were fantastic. The service was really good. The staff mad good recommendations for the food. Food tasted fresh and flavourful. Superb!"
3/2/2019,4 star rating,"I really loved the amazing food and it was priced right. The severs were nice, and you can see the kitchen making the food. The people at the front desk appeared to be altered, and spent half of their time chatting with their friends. I have a lot more to say but I will leave it to the other reviews."
24/10/2016,5 star rating,"Hands down the best Indian food I've ever had.  While we did wait about an hour to be seated, aroind half of that time was inside the restaurant at the bar downstairs.  Be prepared to wait an hour or so as the line never shortens, but make sure to come hungry and leave satisfied.   The service, drinks, menu and overall experience was 5-star.  I will make it a point to recommend this restaurant to everyone who plans to visit London."
27/7/2018,5 star rating,Awesome place! Went there for date night! Love the food! Highly recommended! Very nice ambience and atmosphere. If you are in London and have a bit of liking for fusion Indian food.  You NEED to go here!
14/10/2018,5 star rating,My absolute favorite for casual Indian cuisine. Located conveniently in Coventry Gardens. Highly recommend!
28/1/2019,5 star rating,"Warm & Homely! This bustling Indian-British cuisine was so good. Although on the pricier side, we enjoyed every single bite of our good & drinks. Sit at the bar while waiting for a table and you will be entertained & talked up by the staff. We ordered the Chicken Ruby & I wanted to take it home with me as well. We love Dishoom!!!"
28/1/2019,5 star rating,"Possibly some of the best Indian inspired dishes we had in London. Prices were reasonable, cocktails were wonderfully crafted, atmosphere was fantastic. If  you enjoy spicy food, don't try to let them convince you that it's spicy though."
19/11/2018,5 star rating,"My first time having Indian food and it was AMAZING. Ambience, food, and service were all an A+. Several friends recommended that we should check this place out and know I know why"
27/7/2014,5 star rating,"They will tell you that the wait is about 40-45 minutes but don't be desperate and stay in line because you will probably get in within the next 5 minutes for dinner without reservation The must have dishes are the black daal, garlic naan and their signature chicken tikka. It is a bit spicy but sooo goood. Their Bollybellini is a must try! The staff is ok. The location great for some people watch if you sit outside. A great dinner spot and a favourite of mine. Will definitely be back anytime I am in London"
18/2/2016,3 star rating,"Contrary to what the endless queues outside this place would have you believe, this place is ordinary and far from extraordinary. I think this restaurant is so overrated. Not because it's bad, but because it tastes pretty much like any other fairly good Indian restaurant but with slightly bumped up prices and long lines outside. I didn't find that this restaurant offered anything particularly spectacular or different, which makes me wonder why it has become such a sought-after restaurant. The service is fine, the food is fine, the decor is fine, but that's just it, fine."
17/11/2018,5 star rating,All I have to say eat  lamb samosa. Service is great and food is even better. The best Indian food for westerns ever
30/3/2016,4 star rating,"My friend and I waited about an hour to eat here. About one hour outside and 10 minutes inside. I think if it weren't for the cold, the wait wouldn't have been too bad. We had access to wifi and they served us some hot tea as well. Once we were finally inside, a host came to seat ppl. I was a bit put off bc when it was our turn, he went to each party, skipping over me and my friend, asking if we were the next number. Fortunately, I overheard him and said that we were that number. We ordered the chicken ruby, black daal, Mattar Paneer and garlic naan. I loved the chicken ruby and my friend loved the paneer. We both could have done without the black daal. Not sure I'd wait an hour again but enjoyed our food. Price wasn't so bad"
24/2/2018,5 star rating,"OH MY GOSH! This is my favorite restaurant of all time! If you are in London, you have to go here. The food was spectacular. Definitely worth the wait in the queue. We got the lentils that were so amazing. I am still dreaming about them... ask the waiter for recommendations! They know what is best to get."
13/1/2016,2 star rating,"Very popular place and we loved the fast service, really fast!! However, the food lacked authenticity and we have had much better Indian food elsewhere. Next time in London we'll try someplace else."
11/3/2019,5 star rating,Probably the best Indian I've ever had  the service is fast food is amazing!! really good quality all around so much to choose from would recommend highly!.
14/7/2014,4 star rating,"DISHOOM DISHOOM! Is this the sound of a Bollywood punch?  Or perhaps as the menu suggested, the sound of the food zooming to your table? I tried to figure it out and after eating there, I personally think this is the sound of the flavours exploding in your mouth (Bollywood flavour punch in the mouth?) The dish that had the punch was the famous house black daal, which was really delicious and full of exciting tastes. Nothing else I tried was quite so exciting, but the rightly popular pau bhaji was also a delicious mix of flavours and I loved it too. I have never had pau bhaji before and wasn't sure what to expect, but it was a lovely saucy vegetable mix packed with yumminess that you can eat with garlic naan or whatever bread you prefer. I also really enjoyed the chilli cheese toast, which was such a fun thing to order. Perhaps if I went back I might be able to continue the search for more dishoom flavour! :) Now to less flavoursome dishes. The kacchi lamb biryani was just okay and had not much meat in it, so I wouldn't recommend it. The haleem was better but after a few bites got a bit boring. The masala chai and mango lassi were okay, but I have had better lassi and I don't believe I've ever found a place outside of the subcontinent that can make masala chai the same way. Surprisingly, I did enjoy the interestingly spelled Thums Up soda. Thums Up is the Indian Coca-Cola and tastes as if you left a can of coke next to a sack of cardamom, but in a surprisingly good way. The logo is a hand giving the thumbs up sign, and I really enjoyed the spelling after seeing that. The pistachio kulfi was a good way to end the meal, it wasn't the best I've had but was rich and sweet and hit the spot. As people have said, there is a long wait to get in. I went around 6 and ended up outside in the rain for 45 minutes. Dishoom was kind enough to lend us an umbrella and also to pass out masala chai cups to people in line. I did notice though that after 8:30 on a weekday, there was no line at all, so if you don't want to stand in line, perhaps come around then instead and miss the early rush. Dishoom I notice, also has dates for people who are fasting during Ramadan if you ask for them, and has a special Eid menu coming up which notes that all chicken and lamb are always halal at Dishoom. I really like how considerate they are and look forward to going back again sometime! Their holi celebration also looked amazing on the website and I hope to go next year. They also have something special called a lamb raan bun, which you can only get at the Shoreditch branch, so I will definitely be checking that out!"
15/11/2019,5 star rating,"Came on a recommendation from a friend and waited for an hour to be seated. Absolutely worth every minute. They serve hot chai while we waited, and every bite was delicious."
13/4/2019,4 star rating,"Fantastic eats. The line experience is annoying, but passes fast enough. And it exists for a reason - flavourful plates with lots of options that are UK palate friendly. Would a bit more variety go astray? No - but what's there is reliably delicious and moderately priced."
21/5/2016,4 star rating,"We waited in line for about 45 minutes before being seated. It was midday and we heard the wait can be even longer. I'll tell you, it was worth the wait. We were given mint tea while waiting in line and once seated things just got better. Our server was really attentive and made several suggestions. We started with calamari and samosas. We enjoyed this with the chutney and chili sauce. So good!  Then we had the lamb kabob, black daal, and chicken ruby, cheese naan and basmati rice. What a treat!!! We also had chai and chocolate pudding to end our meal. This exceeded my expectations and I can only hope to find a gem like this when we get back home to NY"
1/9/2018,4 star rating,"Favorite restaurant in London period. Took a star off due to the wait times for all the locations. Their kala sherbet is amazing, always get the chicken ruby with rumali roti. Their spicy lamb chops are great. The seikh Kebab was dry last time. The place has a great vibe and service is generally quick and good. Highly recommend."
12/11/2016,5 star rating,"There are some places worth traveling to eat. As a Californian, I can say that Dishoom is worth paying for a round trip Trans-Atlantic flight to eat at. In particular the Bhel salad stands out as being one of the most unique salads I've ever had. Other Bhel salads do not come close. As a Vegetarian, this restaurant was incredible and to my meat-eating family, they loved it as well. This is perhaps the most important thing to see and experience in London bar-none."
1/7/2017,4 star rating,It's a nice place a bit overrated for what it is but it does have good food and it does have a nice atmosphere
1/4/2016,5 star rating,"I loved this place, went on a late Saturday evening and had the best and only Mango Lassi with Rum!!  Loved it! Food is very tasty and ideal for sharing and enjoy friends. I wouldn't suggest it for big groups as sharing become trickier and that's the best about it. We found it also quite a bargain as we spent less than £50 in three of us, drinks included!"
29/6/2017,5 star rating,Breakfast Meetings are the new lunch :) ... I had to entertain clients for breakfast near my office in Covent Garden and i wanted somewhere a bit special but not in a hotel. A few colleagues recommended Dishoom in St Martins lane which i had been to many times for lunch and wont have even entertain the idea of indian for breakfast. Anyhow first good point you can book. Second good paint it was a very hot sticky day and your greeted by a massive blast of AC (nice) and last but not least the breakfast was absolutely superb - i went for a bacon and egg naan which worked so well with a virgin mary which was fantastic. The pork is from the Ginger Pig butchers and you can have a FEB and there is a good selection of teas and coffee... Id defo go back again and this is now my new breakfast business venue :) Show less

15/10/2019,5 star rating,"Stumbled in here by chance at the midnight hour, which was a great way to skip the line. I had no idea this place had a reputation before going in. We tried the house black dal, the bhel, the naan, and their house lamb dish. The lamb was honestly a little tough, but everything else was excellent, especially the dal and the bhel. And the sauces they give you are amazing. Recommended!!"
18/6/2017,4 star rating,"This place was great. I could smell Indian smell in front of the door already. Nice people, reasonable price and yummy food. but some curries are very spicy.. my friend was almost panicked.. and they gave us free small fruity drinks because of it. :) was kinda funny."
2/1/2015,3 star rating,"So,  I don't know if I didn't get a taste of some of the magic mushrooms other reviews did in order to take this place so highly, but overall I found Dishoom to be pretty disappointing. Upon entering, the decor is nice and funky. Like someone else mentioned,  it's got a cool speakeasy vibe going on. I was really excited, but let down by the service from the beginning. Despite being pretty busy,  we were seated fairly quickly (probably only 15 minutes wait after being told 25-30), but that's when things just took a downturn. The guy who seemed to be in charge of seating seemed pretty disappointed when we said we hadn't ordered any drinks while waiting in the area by the bar, and then after he plonked us at a table, it took almost 15 minutes for someone to notice us and give us menus. But, I tried my best not to let it bother me, as I was excited for their ""Haleem"" dish, which was touted as so special and flavorful. From their online menu: ""for 8 hours we let the wheat, lamb and lentils simmer with precise quantities of coriander, turmeric, cumin and many other aromatic spices. Then the ingredients are pounded to intertwine and infuse the spices, release the flavour, and create a thick, smooth texture, almost a savoury porridge."" My partner ordered the haleem and when I tasted it, I really expected a total flavor explosion in my mouth. Instead, I got an underwhelming mouth of mush. I didn't have a problem with the texture, as it was as described, but I was really expecting more punch and more depth to a dish that was allegedly cooked down for 8 hours with spices. Just...okay. This chef's special, btw, came at a lovely premium of £16.50. Yes, you heard me right. £16.50. For a child's sized portion of porridge. For a drink, I treated myself to the Bombay Pimm's, which was basically just ginger beer in a highball glass with some bits and bobs thrown in the bottom. Waste of £7.50. I also ordered the chicken ruby, which many people here totally raved about, but I also found it devoid of any depth of flavor. It was just any old tomato based sauce to me, and I was let down. Average tasting, but nice to soak up with the naan, which was delicious. Also disappointing, was dessert. A pineapple and black pepper crumble. I was excited for the combo, but when I dug in, found that all I'd really been served was a ramekin of dense, sugary flour crumble with the tiniest layer of unripe pineapple at the very bottom (bleh). I needed to drown it in the provided custard sauce in order to provide any moisture. Also, didn't even taste the slightest hint of black pepper. Really, aside from the annoying service, Dishoom was nothing awful, but definitely underwhelming. Mediocre food and mediocre service, so no, not a very good value at all. I feel as though I could have gotten better, cheaper Indian food somewhere else in London where the staff would have paid a bit more attention.   At the end of the night, I could tell someone at Dishoom knew deep down they'd screwed up, because the owner came over with discount vouchers to placate us. However, given what I think of Dishoom, the option of $10 off a $40 meal at a completely different location isn't exactly very gracious, in my books. Right now, I certainly wouldn't rush to go back (certainly not to the Covent Garden location), but maybe one night if feeling a little tipsy, I'd give Dishoom another try. ."
14/3/2018,5 star rating,"This place is as good as it gets. I've come for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and everything on the menu is flavorful and cooked perfectly. The wait staff are kind and helpful and this place is good for groups or small parties. 10/10 recommend!"
13/9/2016,4 star rating,"Came here on a Sunday at 5pm and had a 45 minute wait for a party of four. The interior was nicely decorated and the fragrant smells were intoxicating. Service was mostly attentive. They were easily able to accommodate my gluten free and dairy free medical dietary restrictions (even had a menu for both).  The prawn moilee was by far the best dish we had. It was truly amazing! The chicken tikka was a distant second for me and the sheekh kabab was skippable. My spouse shared many other dishes with the others in our party and had the same sentiments at the end of the meal. The ingredients seemed fresh and of high quality, but especially for the price-point, we were sadly overall underwhelmed by the food. Not the value we were hoping for. Glad to have checked it off the list and grateful they were so accommodating to my dietary restrictions. Would go back for the prawn moilee alone though! :)"
13/1/2019,5 star rating,Tasty food and excellent service. Line was out the door at 11:20AM for noon lunch. Good experience
16/8/2018,4 star rating,The food was delicious but we had to wait 1.5 hrs to be seated on a Tuesday! The service was very good though. People are nice and friendly. Bartenders are very talented and professional. Would highly recommend... if you have time to spare that is. The wait time is Crazy.
11/1/2019,5 star rating,"My all time favorite Indian and Iranian Cuisine experience. The waiter that we had (Think his name was Alexander) was super amazing for describing everything on the menu being our first time in the restaurant. For a group of 4 we had 3 starter plates to share, the Vegetable Samosa was my favorite smarter. We then shared 5 main course meals and only ended up paying around 100£! The architecture and design of the place is also very on parr for this area in London!"
27/12/2016,4 star rating,The service is good except for the receptionist is too busy to welcome coming guest. Even though the interior setting is very simple and lack of identity.
21/7/2014,4 star rating,"We loved this place for breakfast! My friend and I came here at 8am in the morning and found it empty for once (the line is SO LONG for dinner). I love the decor in here. It's chic, spacious, open and comfortable. Wafts of yummy smells also surround you as you sit waiting to order and eat. After looking at the menu, we had a hard time deciding so we decided to share the naan egg roll (around 5 pounds) and the granola with yogurt and fruit (5.60 pounds I think). Both were really good, especially the naan egg roll. This place is definitely underrated for breakfast! The naan had that perfect chewy, doughy consistency and the two fried eggs were still slightly runny. The tomato spread, cream cheese and sweet chutney perfectly complemented each other. The portion is cut into two pieces, and perfect for one person. The granola with yogurt was a little bit too sweet for our tastes, but it was still really good with vanilla yogurt, honey, fresh fruits (melon, pineapple, grapes, blueberries) and the contrasting texture of crunchy granola. We also ordered coffees (2.50 pounds for an iced Americano or latte). My Americano was probably the best coffee I've had since coming to England and so, so worth it. I definitely recommend this place for a quality breakfast at a reasonable price!!"
5/12/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing!!!!  Agree with the other reviews, you can book at table for lunch and not have to wait.  We arrived a few minutes early and we welcomed with a tasty warm cardamon tea.  We ordered the house black daal, lamb samosas, the Covenant Garden special and the chili ice cream with brownie.  All were amazing!  We can't wait to return."
29/3/2016,4 star rating,The freshest indian food i have ever eaten. its got a real streetr food feel to it and the buzz inside is great. only down fall is you quite often have to queue to get in and the service can sometimes be slow because its so busy. everyone who works there seems very happy and smiles are everywhere! Would highly reccomend!
24/2/2016,4 star rating,"Cool Indian restaurant in the city center! Go on Sunday night to avoid waiting in line for ages. We arrived at 9 PM and it took the team only 5 min to get us a table. Dinner was great, my friend just said she liked cocktails without alcohol better than cocktails with alcohol. But that was her only remark. Apart from that food was perfect."
22/12/2016,5 star rating,"Superb vegetarian curry with tofu and garlic naan! Dishoom slaw had too much mayo but pomegranate seeds in it were very good. We did not have to wait because we went in for early lunch around 12. The waiter was nice and helpful and very attentive. Overall, it was  the best Indian restaurant experience I had."
10/12/2013,4 star rating,"Dishoom has everything you need from Mumbai. I used to work in Mumbai for a few years. And Dishoom actually made me nostalgic. Everything at this place including the tables and chairs, remind me of some cafe in Colaba, Mumbai. Absolutely Indian. The house Chai was fantastic. I don't think I have had Indian Chai like that any where else in London. As Dishoom made me nostalgic, I thought I'd get adventurous and ordered some very Mumbai-ish stuff. Vada pav! Can you believe it? Vada pav is India's answer to Burger. And I used to hog lots of them from the street side vendor near my office in Mumbai. And I have to admit that Dishoom has made it only better. They served it with some chillies and chilli powder. And it is not for those who don't eat spicy food, it is authentically hot! Specifically made for the Indian tongue. Great combination with the Chai. I also tried the Pav Baji and I couldn't believe it. This has got to be someone from Mumbai cooking. Loved every bit of it. But I wasn't done yet. I wanted to try out their Naan and some curries. But Dishoom is not a traditional curry house. It is a cafe and they openly admit that it is a cafe, so they have more snacks and chat and grills and frankies than traditional meals and curries. I went for the Matter Paneer and Garlic Naan. Wow! Flavour rich! It made me believe that I was in India.   But after all that spice rich flavours in my mouth I was still yearning for more. I chose Cinnamon Ice cream for dessert and yet again I drifted away in my fantasy Mumbai. Everything was served in less than 10 minutes. And I was extremely pleased. This is heaven for Indian food lovers and those who have a connection with Mumbai."
14/11/2015,5 star rating,"I'd heard that London had amazing Indian food, but nothing prepared me for Dishoom. I knew I had to try it when there was a line to get in every time I walked past all throughout the weekend, even at off hours like 3pm Saturday. Must-orders: - ruby chicken - pau bhaji - roomali roti But my boyfriend and I tried at least 7-10 different menu items in the two times we ate there and all of them were great. The dishes run just a tad sweeter than your typical Indian fare (at least in NYC), but nothing is one-note or overdone, just super flavorful. Plus on Mondays they let you roll the dice at the end of your meal to get everything for FREE! We didn't win, but a couple of tables around us did - such a cool idea! The establishment is also crazy well run with seemingly everyone on staff in constant communication with each other via headsets. When the line is especially long outside, they bring out cups of hot tea to tide you over. The wait time estimate includes the last 15-20 minutes which are spent inside at the cozy bar downstairs, where you can get started on drinks. For the quality of food, atmosphere, and service, I expected higher prices. I've recommended it to everyone since coming back to the States."
22/6/2016,3 star rating,"I must say I was a bit disappointed... On a Friday night, we waited for 50 minutes before being seated (around 10:30pm). They offered us chai tea during the wait and it wasn't raining, so that was OK. They have an efficient system where they can tell you exactly how much you've been waiting and are very respectful of the order in which you arrived, so it felt like a fair process. We ordered the dahl (house recommendation, £7), a chicken dish (£11) with rice (£2.50), and garlic and cheese naans (£3 each). The dishes were good, but quite spicy, despite being described as mild, and not out of this world - very similar to Indian restaurants in Paris, which are not considered as the best preserved international food in France. The naans were incredible though - we hesitated to order more at the end of our meal, and one week after I'm still longingly thinking about them. Nah, I'm not food-obsessed AT ALL (: Is it good? I guess, if you are more of a spice-lover than us. Is it worth queuing up for 1 hour? Don't think so."
9/3/2016,2 star rating,"London needs to sort it's self out. Falling arse over tit about dishoom. The food is pretty good, admittedly, I can't fault it, there are better Indians in London (lots) and cheaper, but you're not here for the food, you're here for the decor (be honest with yourself on this one if you're currently disagreeing) which is brilliant, really well thought out, and the place has a great ambiance, if you were to walk in, get a table and eat, it would be 4 stars straight away. Even a half hour wait at the bar would be fine. But who the fuck are you kidding when you're expected the queue outside to get in to the bar to wait 2 HOURS for a table. Are they having a fucking laugh? There are seemingly a lot of idiots willing to do this. There are far too many good restaurants in London to justify that wait ever. Let alone at 5pm on a Sunday. On top of this the bar is pretty poor, the cocktails are all done on theme, and most favour throwing in overpowering flavours for the sake of sounding exotic. Classics are neglected, the negroni was pretty lacklustre and pointlessly on some different teir of cocktails that you pour yourself (thanks, my own bottle!) if you're going to make people wait in your bar for 2 hours, make it a decent bar."
8/7/2018,5 star rating,The naan was so good! This place was Recommended by my local London friends and I'm so happy we came. Service was quick and the food was delicious! Would definitely return.
28/11/2013,5 star rating,"One of the best Indian meals I've had while studying abroad in London, and I have exceptionally high standards for Indian food! Not too expensive, I definitely recommend ordering family style here. The interior is really cute as well. Here's what I've had: Kheema Roll - yum, the Kheema is soft (is that a weird way to describe kheema??) and flavorful. Roomali roti - super thin and soft, just the way it should be Maahi tikka - delicious and flaky. Daal - this is amazing dal. Tip: Make a reservation if possible. Also, they'll tell you the wait is much longer than it really is...sit tight. They're trying to weed out the Covent Garden passers-by from the people who really want to eat there!"
19/2/2016,5 star rating,"Best Indian Food Ive ever had! I had heard about this place from one of my patients who recommended it and we coincidentally ran into it while walking around convent garden. We saw a line outside and said lets give it a shot. So happy we did! While we waited outside they gave us Chai Tea or Mint tea while we impatiently waited. When we finally got inside we waited by the bar and ordered a couple of cocktails that were really good. They specialize in Bombay Gin and they re cocktails define fly live up to the name. For lunch we ordered the Chicken , the lamb, the peneer mango salad and the yogurt sauce. Melt in your mouth deliciousness. I wish this restaurant existed in NYC. I would definitely come back when I visit London again ."
10/12/2016,4 star rating,"Had their take on the full english breakfast. The bacon was top-notch, and the akuri eggs were delicious. Otherwise, it's just a full english with an indo-farsi twist, which is in itself cool but maybe not the best choice either for an authentic full english or with respect to Dishoom's other offerings. I didn't like their lassi (as I wasn't aware it's more-than-a-bit salty!) but the staff were nice enough not to charge for it and I ordered their great chai instead. I will definitely return for lunch as well."
24/3/2019,5 star rating,Me and my wife were looking for a breakfast spot and we happened to stumble a upon this place. As we walked in it smelled of everything delicious. Lol. There was fresh naan being cooked and the the Indian spices was just oh so good.
24/11/2018,4 star rating,"You always know there are types of food to eat and not eat when traveling to certain cities. London has great indian food in general, and Dishoom doesnt disappoint. Try the black daal, with a roti, and raita. Drinks are great too. Chicken ruby is a must."
10/1/2016,4 star rating,"I highly recommend the Okra Fries from the all day menu, they're incredibly delicious. I had the Black House Daal which was quite good, but I wanted it to have more of a kick as it was a cold day and I wanted the spices to warm me up from the inside. Apparently on Mondays they do this thing where if you roll a six the meal is free, but I think they use a trick dice as the waitress demonstrated it twice and it landed on two and when I rolled it also landed on two, so I wonder if it's just a gimmick."
4/6/2016,5 star rating,"I really like Dishoom.  The food is really good, the drinks are tasty, the staff are great, it's well run, and the room is kitschy and fun.  I don't know if I like 60% of the menu items but the ruby chicken, breads, veggie curry, samosas and a few other little things are great - oh yah, the okra is pretty good. Don't order that desert they say tastes strange - it really is gross."
25/9/2016,5 star rating,"Best Indian restaurant we've ever been to. The service was excellent, ambiance was great (the bar downstairs is perfect for drinks and dining), and most importantly the food was incredible! (Note: I probably butchered some spellings in this review- too busy to fact check). First, we waited 1 hour at 9pm on Saturday night. If you're not prepared to wait for good food in a major city, then don't-- but don't blame the restaurant! We ordered the lamb kebabs, chicken ruby, house black dahl, garlic naan bread, raita, and the mahi curry. It was all excellent, we'd order it all again. The okra fries were just ok- way too salty for our tastes though the dips were nice.The portions are fairly small, so order plenty of dishes and share nibbles amongst the table. Also they don't custom prepare dishes in terms of spice, so my wife found some dishes uncomfortably spicy, but it's Indian after all so can't complain about that. For drinks their house IPA is excellent and my wife really enjoyed the Bolly-Bellini."
24/9/2018,5 star rating,"Delicious!!! It's our last night in London and Indian food was on our must try list. There was a long line to get in (recommend making a reservation) - was estimated an hour wait, but the wait was less than 30 minutes. My husband and I had the fried okra, garlic naan, ruby chicken, tikka masala and roasted potatoes. Definitely would eat here again if we come back!"
23/9/2018,5 star rating,Came for breakfast . Bacon and egg  naan. Yum.  And surprisingly good americano I had with it.  Super crowded so go early.
21/2/2016,5 star rating,Amazing. Waited for 45 minutes during mid day lunch... And worth every second. Super tasty ruby murray curry.... which for Americans and Canadians is your typical red butter chicken curry you normally get... but this is So much better. Stuffed to the max with some nan bread and rice. Would come back and wait in a heart beat.
25/12/2019,4 star rating,"Impressive Indian food. Modern approach with respect for traditional ingredient and techniques.  Excellent service , nice room and atmosphere.  Prices aren't cheap but expected in this high caliber establishment."
29/5/2014,4 star rating,"I'm a big fan of Dishoom, but I think the bottom line is: would I stand in line, in the cold, to dine here? 20 minutes, maybe, but probably not much more. You see, Dishoom's best when it's empty! At 10am on weekdays you'll see couples brunching, singles with or without laptops (free wifi btw, which they call 'chaifi' hahaha), it's all very relaxed, the restaurant feels airy and bright, and why hello there, BOTTOMLESS CHAI FROM 8AM - 5PM (MONDAY TO THURSDAY)! Breakfast at dishoom is truly underrated. And ultimately, the food's just better when it's less busy. For breakfast, get the egg naan roll. 4 out of 5 times it's done perfect - gooey, runny yolk, and who knew cream cheese went with fried eggs? The magic really is the fresh herbs and tartness of the tomato chili jam thing, it's addictive. And of course, fluffy yet dense naan with just the right amount of chew. That and a cup of chai.. best way to start the day. Lunch and dinner, where do I begin? Okra fries - crispy, deep fried veggies, what's not to like? Pau bahji - veg could've had more flavour but the bread's a buttered, fluffy cloud! Skate cheeks - ah, are my favourite! So so juicy, tender and that tamarind!!! Mahi Tikka - so moistttt and super tasty Naan's better than the roti (just personal preference really) Feel like I've tried more dishes but I guess they weren't as memorable. Overall, I really like Dishoom (both here and Shoreditch) but it's definitely anglicised indian fare, so don't expect anything super punchy! Oh and try the kulfi! It really is just frozen condensed milk but the consistency sure it satisfying! Also, having been to this branch and the one in Shoreditch multiple times, somehow the food is always slightly better here, but the ambience / decor in Shoreditch really takes the cake."
7/7/2018,5 star rating,"This is a very stylish indian restaurant.  All of the dishes we beautifully spicey in that the spice flavors were pronounced and distinctive, but they they all worked in perfect harmony.  I don't know where they get their spices from, but they are beautiful. The service was outstanding.  If I lived in London, I would be here every week."
19/3/2016,4 star rating,"Amazing modern Indian cuisine. Decor is very atmospheric, dim lighting make you feel like you're somewhere that has its pulse on the London trends. The food is creative and absolutely delicious. The black dahl is a MUST as are the gunpowder potatoes. I hear the cocktails are great, though haven't tried them myself. If you like coke and want something similar you wont find anywhere else in London then buy a thumbs up. Think masala cola...???... The only reason that this place doesn't get 5* is the disappointing lack of vegetarian mains. I really wanted to give Dishoom  5* but there just aren't that many options. The veggy mains I've tried didn't rock my world. The Tikka Panneer was dry and rubbery. Very sad. Ah well, if you stay away from that it's all delicious! I would certainly recommend Dishoom to a friend. A really great, interesting and not too expensive place to eat. Just tell them if they're veggy to stick to the small dishes."
30/7/2016,5 star rating,"Best indian food i have had thus far. They serve sherry and chai when you wait in the cue outside. Despite the wait being near one hour, the food was well worth it. We began with calamari, garlic naan and black daal which was simmered perfectly. Next, we ordered the spicy lamb chops and they were cooked to perfection. I sill have the taste of the Masala prawns in my mouth and I certainly do not mind. Paneer tikka was very flavorful and cooked to perfection. This is my new London spot for indian! The portions of the naan and roti are quite small so you may need a few orders depending on varying level of hunger. Well worth a try!"
7/9/2015,5 star rating,"Who would have thought that the best Indian I ever had is in London. The food is absolutely amazing, I loved every dish I tried. Thx to my fellow yelpers, we ordered the black daal with prawns, ruby chicken and pau bauji. The ruby chicken was definitely my favorite. But all 3 were very flavorful, and the staff was very nice. Make a reso to avoid the long line. We didn't have a reso and arrived with an hour and half wait... No one left with this long line so we figured it must be good. TOTALLY WORTH IT! it was cold out and the hostess brought out chai teas for ppl in line, I thought that was a nice touch. You stand in line outside and then you get sent to the bar before you are sat down. Must try though, If you're craving for Indian food"
27/7/2018,5 star rating,"I am not an Indian food fan but this place has me converted.  Chicken, Mahi, Garlic Naan, Veg Samosa with signature black bean dip were all delicious.  We arrived at 5:30 on a Fri evening at Picadilly branch and was told wait was up to 40 min.  We were seated at our table in 30, food was delivered quickly and we were done with check paid one hour after getting in line."
10/1/2016,4 star rating,Street food Indian style you ask? Of course you say!  Different from the typical gee filled cooking from traditional cooking this place is right up my alley with little plays encouraging got to order many to share with friends or even on a cute little date! Sometimes there is a queue but that's the fun of it!
2/4/2014,5 star rating,"We popped in for dinner one weeknight and found that there was a wait.  We were sent downstairs to the bar and my God what a revelation! The cocktails were quite outstanding, as were the friendly and skilled bartenders.  Literally everything we tried was new, interesting, and expertly made.  And we made an extensive sample of the in house cocktail menu. The Indian food was very good, but the cocktails were a knockout."
20/10/2015,5 star rating,"I've eaten out 2-3x meals a day all over the UK for the past 40 days and this was the first meal I've had where I was genuinely impressed, with everything. Nothing lacking, in any regard. Food was excellent - very flavorful, cooked to perfection, great diversity on menu with very distinct flavors. Service was very good, helpful with suggestions, attentive, and showed genuine care and concern for satisfaction with the experience. The wait to be seated was handled impressively well with ginger chai tea served, an organized wait list handled on an iPad, and advance bar seating during the second half of the wait. Perfection."
1/9/2014,5 star rating,"So good!  We wanted the best Indian food in London and we found it. The chicken ruby, the naan bread with garlic, the other stuff I can't pronounce.  Truly, go here and get the best ever!! Get there early unless you want to queue for at least 30 mins or more. Fast service.  Food comes out as it is ready, not in the order you place it.  Deal with it.  It works!"
29/3/2018,5 star rating,"My boyfriend and I dropped by for dinner before heading to catch an opera in early November, and we got there just in time. The line quickly grew moments after we arrived. Although we had to wait outside in the cold, servers brought out small glasses of chai hot chocolate. I had never been to an Indian restaurant nor tried Indian cuisine, and that was such a perfect introduction to what lied ahead. Once seated, the waitress informed us of how dishes were served family style there and went through various menu options and recommendations, which were incredibly helpful to me. I remember us ordering the chicken ruby, roti, house black daal, gunpowder potatoes, and a rice. We both found everything to be incredibly delectable! He had Indian cuisine before and stated that this was, by far, the best he has had. I fell in love. We regularly think back on this restaurant and wish there were one in Houston! We will definitely be stopping at a Dishoom if we're ever in London again."
31/10/2018,5 star rating,"Wow! This was an amazing Indian dinner. We got the lamb Keema (best thing we tried), roti chicken (sauce and chicken were amazing), pulled lamb on a bun, and the Dali. Everything was great, however we were a bit jet lagged and had high tea earlier in the day, so the meal was a bit heavy. But the lamb keema and chicken were to die for. Also the house IPA was great. I will definitely go back here whenever I visit London again."
26/10/2018,5 star rating,"Yum! Definitely try to go early to avoid a long wait but even still, the wait is worth it! We shared several dishes and enjoyed them all-- some can be spicy but fortunately I had some extra yogurt sauce from one of the dishes to help cool off the heat. From the looks of the other tables, seems like you can't go wrong!"
21/8/2016,3 star rating,"After a short wait outside for around 15 minutes, with some free warm tea (which was refreshing and well-received), the world turned around. We were given a beeper and directed to the bar to relax, which was very noisy. There also were not enough seats at the bar where we were expected to wait, so we stood for a while. Eventually we were given a seat. Overall the restaurant is full and noisy, and the servers pressured us to order more food (also, they thought we ordered something we did not order). As for the food... The Chicken Ruby was a delicious and exceptional dish, with a rich, spicy, and creamy sauce that went perfectly with the succulent chicken. 10/10 absolutely recommended, though it comes with no rice or naan. On the other hand, the Vegetable Biryani was basically £7.50 for a bowl of mushy rice with inadequate flavor, giant potatoes, rather little in the vegetable department, and overall disappointment. If you come here, it's overall pretty average - everything balances out. But do try that Chicken Ruby - it's good."
22/10/2018,5 star rating,Fantastic! My friend and I found everything amazing from the cocktails to all of our orders. Even the side salad with peas and spinach was amazing. I'm not a bug fan if Indian food but this place blew me away!
11/5/2018,5 star rating,"Great vintage ambience, great food which boasted of quality, tasty authentic food with a bit of a twist. You may have to wait a while but it's worth the wait. The portions are fairly small and it is expensive. We ended up ordering for the family of 6 and then ended up ordering again due to small portions. The Pav bhaji, vada Pav, paneer kathi roll and the daal were some of the favo"

The Pav bhaji, vada Pav, paneer kathi roll and the daal were some of the favourites!"
22/1/2019,4 star rating,"Stopped here for breakfast to try their famous bacon naan wrap, and it did not disappoint.  Super tasty, puts other breakfast sandwiches to shame.  Also had the breakfast lassi which was... not very refreshing, but very tasty!"
1/6/2018,5 star rating,I can't help myself.. I just keep coming back and consistently the dishes are fabulous. As a vegetarian there are some great options.. Don't eat before dinner and come hungry!!! Order the Chai--best around.
15/10/2018,5 star rating,"Absolutely amazing worth the wait.  Get chicken Ruby , garlic nan and Shrimp Marcella   If possible.   upstairs in a booth With a server name Antonio"
20/1/2019,5 star rating,"Worth the hype! We waited for a table for 2 for about an hour at 5:30p on a weekday. It was cold out, but they brought out hot chai tea for everyone waiting in line, which was a lovely touch. The chai was also the best I've EVER had. All of the food we ordered was amazing, but the mahi tikka and the dhal were clear winners. The atmosphere was amazing and the wait staff made sure we had everything we needed, while also not making us feel rushed."
22/2/2019,3 star rating,"The food is generally good but the portion sizes could be larger. Also, it's far too busy without adequate space to sit comfortably and talk. The waiters are constantly rushing you to finish and leave."
4/8/2016,5 star rating,"I had a good experience here.  The wait was set at 1hr 20min but I got into the bar area (got the (Viceory's Old Fashion) maybe 25min later.  And then I was seated 10min later.  Service is great and they are a well oiled machine.   Everything I ordered was really good.  I got the garlic naan, the Chicken Tikka, Ocra fries, lamb samosas, and the Black House Daal.  The food that stood out for me the most was actually the Dishoom Calamari. I'll be back when I return to London."
6/10/2018,5 star rating,"I don't just love this Indian restaurant, I really, really love this place. I am not a believer in standing in line for good food, especially in London, when there is so many good ones around every corner...but I have stood in line numerous times for this spot. Why? Because if you stand in line, at times they will bring you the most amazing chai to make it worth your while. Now in any other Indian restaurant, you are going to see your usual samosas, pakoras, naan, Tikka masala, etc...sure you will see those here, too, but this restaurant you will offer you things not offered elsewhere. The chili cheese toast for one is delicious...simple, with cheese and chives...I don't know why it is absolutely mind-blowing, but it is. Then, you get to the nitty gritty with the okra that is so crispy and always feels fresh. The roomali roti lives up to it's name by being handkerchief thin that you can inhale five before you realize. Now don't forget to go downstairs to the bar and have the bartender whip you up some unique drinks or the very reliably yummy mango lassi. The wait staff could not be nicer. Rain or shine, and I hate the rain, I am willing to wait to eat at this restaurant...now that's saying something!"
22/10/2015,5 star rating,"A six o'clock arrival at the back of the line on a Thursday night gave us a 40 minute wait outside with some chain, followed by a 20 minute pause at the bar. Downstairs is noisy, so we opted for an upstairs table on the street level. Food was worth the wait."
3/10/2018,3 star rating,The service was good.  I waited 35 minutes to find out as I was seated that they needed my table in 80 mins.  Fine I am an American diner who is pretty quick anyways.  Thought long and hard about the food tasty but a bit over rated.  I expect with all of the buzz this be the best Indian I have ever had.  Not the case.
30/7/2018,5 star rating,"The atmosphere is great, cocktails are lovely, staff is super efficient and friendly and they have a vegan menu option now. Love Dishoom!!"
17/3/2017,4 star rating,"Food was good but I would not have been happy if I had waited in the legendary queues. I have spoken with people who've waited for an hour and 45 mins. Stand out food is black dhal, chicken curry and okra fries. We recommend booking for a lunch meal, no need to queue."
27/7/2018,5 star rating,"Given the long line to get in, (even in the rain!) it is hard not to have really high expectations.  Suffice it to say they were exceeded.  The food was spectacular and the service amazing.  I don't need to recommend anything, just ask your server, as we did our wonderful Kay, and you are in for a true treat."
27/9/2018,5 star rating,"Absolutely delicious! Wonderful flavors, great service and new and interesting dishes to try! Make sure to get the chai."
12/1/2019,5 star rating,"Great food, nice environment. Popular for a reason; but if you know where to look, you can match the food quality at lower prices. But I enjoy more than just the food there: good drinks, interesting crowd, and great (or central) location."
14/4/2016,5 star rating,"We loved this place! We came here for lunch with our 8 month old baby and everyone was super nice, accommodating and attentive! Food was amazing and my hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed our food! Would come back when we return to London again!"
2/12/2015,5 star rating,"Dishoom is one of my favorite places in London. There is always a queue but it is certainly worth the wait. I'm sad they don't have the Rajma Frankie on the menu more (or maybe they'll rotate it back on) but the food here is always flavorful and delicious. The dal makhni is by far in my top 2 dals I've had ever had - second only to a place in Jaipur. Dishoom has some of the best roomali roti hands down. Whether you have it with your frankie or with another menu item, you can't miss out. I'm personally a fan of the dal (mentioned earlier), the frankies, pau bhaji, the chai and the kulfis. Every time I'm in London, I look forward to going to Dishoom (and will go out of my way to do so). The service here is always great and they do their best to get you seated as quickly as possible. I love the modern but also classic Bollywood decor, which gives this place great personality. If you live in London and you haven't been to Dishoom, what have you been doing?"
6/5/2018,5 star rating,"The food here is great. Waited in line for about 45 min in the cold weather, but it was worth the wait."
1/6/2018,5 star rating,"Taste better that what I was expected. I had the garlic nan, chicken ruby, calamari, fish something and shrimp something. I guess I am coming back for dinner tomorrow! Better than the best Indian restaurant in san Francisco and los angeles"
17/9/2018,4 star rating,After standing in line for over an hour we were finally granted entrance into Dishoom. The restaurant is loud and lively on weekends. We were taken downstairs and ordered drinks. Unfortunately I don't remember all the names of the dishes we had. We tried two different appetizers one being behel (perhaps wrong spelling) it was delightful. I had the lamb biryani which they said was spicy but wasn't really spicy at all. My friend had a yummy chicken dish which also wasn't spicy. I would say this place is worth the wait. The food and atmosphere but are worth the wait.
21/1/2018,5 star rating,What can I say about Dishoom that hasn't already been said?........Not much. So I'll keep it short. Prawn Koliwada - Yum! Has a really nice kick Chicken Ruby - Get it. Shhhhhh. Don't ask questions. Just get it. Prawn Moilee - Mild compared to most Indian dishes but delicious! Garlic Naan - Obvious must Dishoom Slaw - Refreshing and a great palate cleanser Okra Fries - Spicy & crunchy To be honest I think I blacked out a little because I was too excited. Everything was A1. Please open a location in NYC.
13/7/2018,5 star rating,"I had the Chicken Ruby and it was absolutely amazing.  The portion looked small at first but they packed a lot of Chicken in the bowl.  The Chicken Ruby tastes pretty much like Chicken Tikka Masala but a bit spicier (not be much).  The lines are long here, so be sure to arrive before the lunch/dinner rush."
24/10/2015,5 star rating,"I'm not always the hugest fan of Indian food but Dishoom hits the spot. It takes me back to my childhood with familiar dishes of street food interspersed with beautiful curries. The familiarity is due to the owners growing up in East Africa- similar to my family. (i believe the parentals know each other?) I've been to most of the branches with the exception of the latest in Carnaby St and all have something to recommend them. The branch in King's Cross is huge - love the layout of a train station. But I mostly pop into the Shoreditch branch at quiet times as I'm often in the area. This time, I brought my mum and we chose to sit in their verandah/ conservatory area. Perfect on a sunny day and when you are a smaller group. I've sat here on my own with my laptop in the afternoon at times. I'd just been for a workout so opted for a healthier option of pulled Murgh malai chicken & pomegranate salad with nimbu pani - the homemade lemonade with salt and sugar. It's the perfect drink for rehydrating and not too sweet. The chicken was tender and salad fresh and crunchy. Mum had the chilli cheese toast and we shared some greens. The cheese on toast was just like the fusion snack that we would have at home. We both had a chocolate chai - wow! Why have I never had one of those before with my chocolate fixation? I'm not a huge fan of queuing for anything so prefer to book a table or visit at quieter times. The breakfast naan with bacon is beyond amazing."
10/7/2018,5 star rating,"All the previous reviews pretty much covered it. Amazing food, well organized in terms of wait times and collecting you for your table. Serving sizes were good and creative drink selections. Best Indian feast we have had in a loooonnnngggg time."
27/2/2016,5 star rating,"Dishoom serves Indian unlike any you've had before, and it's absolutely fantastic. Forget the heavy handed kormas, curries and oily naans etc. Dishoom does Indian food justice and does it damned good! I've been here for both breakfast and dinner, and they're among some of the best you can get in London. If you can book in advance, DO IT, because the queues here can get ridiculously long with several hour waits if you're really that keen. But is it worth it? Yes. £5/6 for an absolutely incredible bacon or naan roll? £2.50 for bottomless chai? Brunch sorted for under £10, and get a stamp on a loyalty card giving you free brunch after only 5 stamps! Dinner wise? Go with a bunch of mates and just order everything on the menu, you won't be disappointed. Personal favourites are the pau buns - so soft and buttery! Definitely a highlight of the London dining scene for me, and has even converted some of my curry hating friends to the light!"
9/7/2018,5 star rating,"This restaurant is amazing!! I was traveling in London for 2 days only and was told it's a must try, and I'm glad I stopped in! I had the chicken ruby which was delicious, and the chicken so tender. The naan was buttery and fluffy, mango lassi was light and refreshing, and samosas crispy and flavorful. Get there on the early side because it fills up quickly and they don't take reservations; I got to the restaurant at 6pm and was seated at 7pm, but well worth the wait!"
3/10/2015,5 star rating,"I'm a big Dishoom fan, but I'd never eaten at the Covent Garden restaurant until this week. I dashed out of work at 5pm to try and beat the queues (no prebooking unless for 6 or more people and even then only a few tables can be prebooking). The queue beat me. I arrived and we had a 45 minute wait. Luckily the brought out chai and mint teas and we probably only queued about 30 mins until we were seated at the bar to wait for a little bit longer. We ordered lovely cocktails and were soon taken to our table. Our waiter Joseph was really lovely, helpful and attentive. Dishoom is all about sharing dishes so we ordered keema pau, chicken ruby, black Dahl, lamb kebab, roti and rice. It was all delicious, plentiful and wonderfully flavoured. We all tucked in and thoroughly enjoyed our delicious dishes. We treated ourselves to sharing a gooey chocolate dessert which came with a scoop of chilli vanilla ice cream. A wonderful, naughty end to the meal. We paid about £22 each for dinner and a cocktail each, which is really good value for a great meal in London. And our waiter even took our friends mocks ail when he noticed she hadn't drunk it cos she didn't really like the taste, which is fab service. Get yourself to Dishoom pronto. Don't be put off by the queue... It's worth it!"
21/5/2018,5 star rating,Great Indian food. Great flavors and atmosphere. I would highly recommend this place. Show up early or expect a wait.
3/7/2018,5 star rating,"This was a great meal. Service was outstanding. My favorite dishes were the greens bowl, the chicken tikka, and the daal bowl."
14/5/2016,5 star rating,"This place definitely knows how to make people wait. My friend and I got there around 6 (which we thought was pretty early) and there was already an hour queue. The thing is, you have to stay in the queue the whole time instead of just leaving your number and coming back. To make the wait better, we were given chai and some dessert liquor. After about 40 minutes, we were taken into the bar and finished waiting there. It honestly didnt feel as long as it was rather it just felt like part of the experience. The inside is simply but well decorated. The staff is very friendly and helpful about explaining the food and how the restaurant works. My friend is indian and so she ordered for both of us. The food came pretty quickly and everything we ordered was delicious. The chicken biryani was probably the best Ive ever had and went perfect with the daal. Overall a fabulous meal. The restaurant does not disappoint and I get the hype around it. Highly recommend but pro tip is to head there around an hour and a half before you want to eat."
3/1/2018,3 star rating,"I think this is overrated. Stood in line for almost an hour and got in. Ordered Wada Pav, Kali Dal and Paneer Roll. Kali Dal was okay not over the top as other reviews are saying. Same for Wada Pav and Paneer roll. Definitely overpriced IMHO"
22/11/2017,5 star rating,"I'll start with the bad - 1 hour 30 minute wait on a Friday night. That's all the bad. Now the good. They brought a delicious chai tea mint drink to people waiting to get in. Nice to have during the chilly wait. The food was amazing! The chicken tikka was very spicy for us since we're from the Pacific Northwest. My fiancé couldn't eat it but I ate it all using rice and my delicious cocktail to eat it all up! The black daal was out of this world, as was the lamb kofkta kabob. The caramel ice cream was pretty good. I wasn't a huge fan of my meringue, cream, and berry dessert, but it was still interesting and I'm glad I tried it! Super delicious overall! If you have the time for the wait, try it!"
22/3/2018,5 star rating,"This was recommended to us by friends for a recent trip to London.  We arrived here on our first night in London, jet lagged and hungry.  There was a short line, but we were greeted and given a warming cup of mint tea for our wait.  It went quickly and we were seated downstairs.  Craft cocktails and a great ambience, lively and fun!  We had a delicious meal and would definitely come back!  We almost went twice during our trip, it was that good!"
11/11/2019,5 star rating,The wait is always long but absolutely worth it the food was fantastic my favorite was the lamp chops
25/6/2016,5 star rating,"My husband and I were visiting from the States and used Yelp to find this place on a day we were out exploring the city. IT WAS AMAZING. Maybe the best meal we had during our entire 2 week trip through the UK and Ireland. We ordered the chicken ruby, chicken tikka, bowl of greens, daal, and naan on the side, washed down with Kingfisher (not a beer commonly seen in AZ). Everything was incredibly flavorful and delicious. The chicken was tender and seasoned perfectly. We both left this meal telling each other we could eat it every day. Wait staff was attentive and pleasant, and the atmosphere was modern and gorgeous. Definitely a must try."
17/6/2018,5 star rating,"Not only was this the best Indian restaurant I had in London, it was probably the best restaurant I went to in London!! Everything was great from service, to decoration, and yes the food...can't wait to go back!!"
13/9/2015,5 star rating,The queue is very long but it is definitely worth the wait! You can have some lassi while waiting and the food!!! excellent. We ate vegetarian and it was one of the best indian food I ever had!
5/11/2015,5 star rating,"We went twice in 14 hours because this place is BOMB AF.   Everything about the restaurant is really charming, from the design to the plating, and even the bathrooms.  I don't think that the food is overpriced like a lot of people are saying, the quality is really nice and they are in the heart of London and in London, everything is expensive.   My favorite thing to get is the mahi tikka.  Fish is perfectly cooked and moist and tender and flaky and i dont even know what else to say you just gotta try it. Ruby chicken is also awesome with just the right amount of spice and the sauce is great for tipping your naan or roti into.   If you're looking for great drinks, Dishoom has them too.  They have a lot of original cocktail recipes, but if you're not into alcoholic drinks, their wide selection of lassis are great too.  My personal favorite is the rose lassi. The lines can be long but the wait is worth it.  Just go in the afternoon on a weekday and there should be no wait."
22/7/2015,5 star rating,"I've never went out of my way to try an Indian restaurant like I did for Dishoom. I walked 15 miles before I reached this gem! After the long and exhausting walk, I seated myself in this nice, air conditioned, and loud restaurant. First impression- very modern restaurant and very pretty. I feel like everything in the UK is 10x more prettier and hipster than America lol. We were seated within 5-10 minutes on a busy day on the main floor (there's a floor downstairs with the bathroom and very dim lighting, it's pretty awesome). We were given menus and these sauces that came in cute metal buckets. I forgot what I had ordered, but I remember that the chicken ruby, garlic naan, samosas, and basically everything was DELICIOUS. They were all pounding with flavor and I can still taste those spices lingering in my mouth! Yum. Despite the long journey I had taken to reach this destination, I can say it was well worth it. & if I ever visit London again, I will for sure have this restaurant on the top of my visiting list!"
2/4/2018,4 star rating,"We went there on a Monday night and the wait was much shorter than expected. The starters were delicious, flavorful and quite unique. The main dishes were not as exeptional, but still very good. The place has a modern and trendy vibe and the service was impeccable.  We will definitely be coming back."
11/11/2015,5 star rating,"Awesome restaurant!   Very well organized, even though there was a long wait we were well treated and their system works very well. The Black Daal was amazing. Best Indian dish I've ever had. The Chicken Ruby was great as well. The naan and the other sides were good. Highly recommended."
10/6/2018,5 star rating,"Wow! This place is fantastic!! Ask them if u can mix the garlic and cheese naan. Sooo amazing. Chicken ruby was perfectly seasoned and delicious. I'm not big on Indian food but I will be going back here ASAP! I got there when there was no line but as soon as I left, there was a line of 25-30 people, so you may want to call in advance. This place is a must if you are in London!"
24/10/2016,5 star rating,"Wow! The Drinks are Amazing! The 1948 Sour is a must try!!! A dry whiskey with creamy foam of the egg white, peach, hibiscus, honey fresh lemon!!"
27/1/2016,4 star rating,"Came here for breakfast and had a great time. The decor of the place is great and has a unique mix of old school dining mixed in with new elements. We had one of the egg dishes, bacon naan and the masala beans. The egg dish was unique, hearty and cheap. Adding the masala beans as a side was a good decision and it paired well. The bacon naan was good but it didn't wow me as the other two dishes. We also got their house chai tea and cappuccino. I received a refill of the team but wasn't charged for it. Not sure if they offer free refills or if this was an exception. Truly a unique dining experience and I'm hopeful someone will open a similar restaurant in New York. Breakfast was well priced and I wish we could have returned for another meal while we were in London."
15/8/2017,4 star rating,"Made a booking for Sunday brunch (a must-do, unless you want to wait in line forever), and really enjoyed it!  Our servers took a while to get our drink order and bring us water initially, but once that was sorted things moved very quickly, and they were extremely gracious when some members of our party wanted runnier eggs, replacing the dishes and taking them off the bill, which was almost too kind! I got the akuri - lovely soft spiced scrambled eggs with some buttered buns and a grilled tomato.  This was a very simple dish, and a light breakfast, but the eggs were lovely with complex flavors.  If you're really hungry, get a side of some meat.  I got a side of some vanilla yogurt (you could see the vanilla bean flecks in it) with fresh fruit like grapes and mango and berries in it, which was just gorgeous and made a great side dish or brunch sharing plate.  Or just eat it yourself!  My husband loved his Big Bombay (like an Indian-spiced full English) and my sister-in-law said the bacon egg naan was perfect for a hangover.  It looked absolutely glorious so I'll have to get that next time.  In the end everyone thought their food was gorgeous - the only thing I could've wanted was quicker service initially, and less watery fresh orange juice (lots of ice cubes in the glass, felt like a bit of a rip off).  Also the buns that come with the eggs are quite plain - was hoping for something with a little more pizazz.  But all very minor complaints over the course of a generally terrific meal. We also saw a server handing out mugs of chai to people waiting in line outside, so maybe DON'T make a reservation, haha!"
3/1/2016,4 star rating,"If given the option, I would rate the service at a 5 and food at a 4. We were given an estimated wait time of 1 hour and 30 minutes, however it was much quicker. Also, the wait  included time spent at the bar (very small bar area downstairs). As we waited in line, we were served chai and given umbrellas for the rain. This was very convenient and excellent service! As for the food, it was very good, but it was not significantly better then some other places I tried in chicago. We ordered lamb samosas (good - comes with 4 pieces), house black daal (highly recommend), garlic naan (too burnt), Kachi lamb (very good), chicken ruby (good), mango lassi (okay - I probably wouldn't get it again because it was a bit bland), mint tea (I would not recommend because there were not enough mint leaves or did not steep long enough. It lacked a lot of flavor) and strawberry desert (very good if you like cream and strawberries. It was not very sweet, so it was perfect! ). Overall, the restaurant was a very good experience!"
5/6/2018,4 star rating,"When we arrived at around 6:30 on a Friday night, there was a long line down the street, but it moved quickly and we were glad we waited! The food was excellent, and the atmosphere was great; admittedly, the service was fair to poor. Our food arrived quickly, but our server wasn't attentive about refilling drinks or bringing the bill. I would still go again and again."
2/6/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing! Loved the flavors. I was solo, so going back soon to try more dishes. Worth the wait."
25/1/2018,5 star rating,"I've always loved Indian food and I've been to many good ones, but dishoom has to be the absolute best I've ever had. Everything was so flavorful and amazingly delicious. Our favorites had to be the calamari (we ordered two), pau bhaji, and chicken ruby. The chili cheese toast was also very good and I recommend ordering the jackfruit biryani. The wait was a little more than an hour for us on a Saturday night at 7pm but absolutely worth it since they give you free chai tea in line!"
29/7/2017,5 star rating,"We tried to make reservations and didn't get a call back until 24 hours later. At that point there were no more reservations, but we were told that if we came at 530, it would only be a 30 min wait. We decided to do this and cancel another reservation we had for ten people with 4 kids. We get to dishoom and there is a 2 hour wait! We found out that the reservation service is at a headquarters offsite and that they don't know the true wait times. We were frustrated because we had hungry kids and we cancelled a reservation and had no real food options. The manager Luna stepped in and bent over backwards to make it work for us. We really appreciate the service and would recommend this place to anyone. Additionally the food was really good! Highly recommended and no doubt a 5 star place"
30/10/2019,5 star rating,"Just go here, believe the hype. So so so so delicious. Derive is great, the ruby dish is amazing and we got like three of them we couldn't stop. Even the Appetizers that was all greens was phenomenal. This place is a must, and super fun dark loud environment."
14/10/2018,5 star rating,"The wait was a bummer but the food was worth the wait. Everything from the simple mixed greens,potatoes and onions to the lamb was mouth watering and very appetizing. The food was affordable, the ambiance was amazing and again the food was more than satisfying. Not to mention the staff was incredibly pleasant and friendly.  I recommend going during lunch to try and avoid the large line."
7/2/2014,4 star rating,"It took quite a while before I first visited Dishoom. On my first visit, we had just missed the breakfast menu, so we settled for the all-day menu. Our waiter was friendly and kindly recommended some dishes for us to share. We ordered some naan and a few curries to share, including the house black daal which was quite dark and rich. I ordered the House Chai, and also redeemed my free mango lassi as it was my first visit. Felt so full (but happy) towards the end :p On my second visit, me and my friend dropped in for brunch. I tried the chocolate chai this time, which was very warming and comforting after coming in from the cold outside. I finally tried the much talked about bacon naan roll which had chilli tomato jam, cream cheese and herbs. Warm and freshly made, though I would have preferred more of a kick from the chilli (me and my love for spiciness...) We also ordered the Akuri - spicy scrambled eggs, which is an Irani staple. A lovely blend of spices - I may actually try this at home sometime and add some excitement to my scrambled eggs, ha. Overall I enjoyed the food, and also the ambience of the place. A wide variety of small dishes to share and centrally located close to Covent Garden/Leicester Square station. Full blog post here: dancing-in-high-heels.bl…"
21/8/2013,4 star rating,"Dishoom was definitely a good experience. We arrived without a reservation (bad idea) but we were accomodated in their bar underground (with curious drinks which we tried to our satisfaction!). In about 30 minutes there was a table for us. Dinner is served family style as they would say in the US, dishes come as soon as they are ready and are sizable enough to share. We enjoyed every single dish we picked, and the service was fast and courteous enough."
12/10/2016,4 star rating,"I'd say this place is a bit over-hyped, but does serve very delicious Indian food. Came here with a group of 10 for a work outing. Total price was about £50 a head and we were well fed and well hydrated. I'd recommend the samosas (lamb or veggie), chili cheese toast, chicken tikka from the grill, okra fries, and masala prawns. Didn't think the black daal was particularly memorable - tasted a bit watery! My wife isn't too keen on Indian food, but I think she'd find some dishes to try here - it's not too exotic."
19/7/2017,5 star rating,"Some of the best Indian food I've had (and I've had a lot)--far and away the best of the five Indian restaurants we tried on our trip to London. Wonderful atmosphere in each of the seating areas. Good service, even though they were busy. The Black Daal was amazing, as was Ruby's chicken. Good naan, good appetizers. And one of the best gin and tonics I've had in a long time, too."
20/3/2017,5 star rating,"Back tracking favorite meals in London. Made a reservation for Dishoom after hearing so many great things! Large table of 8 seated right as we got there (without a reservation, it's at least an hour and a half wait as there are always long queues!), I had a great time with good service. The chicken biryani and chicken ruby were delicious! I finished the meal with their mango kulfi! Yum!"
7/4/2018,5 star rating,"I eat indian food regularly (in California) and it's really good, but this was excellent! There was so much flavor, even if it was mild spice, it was all so tasty. I also loved the ambiance and the cocktails. I visited this restaurant with some friends who were all in town the same night. I flew out the next day, but my partner who stayed for business went back twice that week. I am eager to revisit London just to come back here. ;)"
6/4/2018,5 star rating,"The food was delicious and the staff was friendly. It's surprising that England is a huge fan of Indian food, but hey its a thing. Enjoyed this place a lot and would eat here again."
8/3/2016,5 star rating,"I love it. I just love it. Anyone who knows me knows that I love it and I can't even put my finger on why? Especially because this review is solely focusing on their breakfast offerings. Of all the Dishoom locations this is probably the one with the least ambience and decor and for that reason you're usually more likely to get a table. Top tip: Even though you can't book in the evening unless you have 6+ in your party, you can in the morning so book your breakfast table to avoid a wait or disappointment! They do breakfast cocktails but do not start serving these until 11am so if you're looking to get started early - make sure you head in around this time. I have gone through pretty much everything on their breakfast menu by now and I have to say that the bacon naan with egg is still a winner. Those fluffy naan breads with the chutney inside just transforms the traditional bacon sarnie. I'm usually of the opinion that if it's not broke don't fix it but I'm so glad they fixed it. It's beautiful. The big bombay is their take on a 'full English' and it's massive. Home made beans or peoples take on beans is one of my pet peeves in trendy breakfast spots but the beans here are absolutely delicious and I have no idea what it is they have done to the eggs but again - taste sensation. I wont go through everything on the menu as that would be boring. The only thing I'd say is personally I really dislike their porridge and would avoid that but then, I've seen other people loving it so it depends on your personal taste. Personally, I'm not a fan of the coffee there either so usually opt for the freshly squeezed If you ask for a loyalty card you can get a free bacon naan after you've had breakfast there five times. Well worth it!"
16/5/2018,5 star rating,"Great food. We had several people recommend this one & it lived up to the hype! Every we ordered was awesome: chicken curry, naan bread, coleslaw, & pau bhaji."
15/7/2018,5 star rating,"Great way to top off my visit to London. Don't let the line scare you off, you won't find a better meal anywhere. The staff is friendly and will serve you little glasses of sherry while you wait in line. Menu is quite large so get organized when placing your order. Dishes came out fast, fresh and hot. The lively atmosphere is great for groups. Loved it."
1/5/2015,5 star rating,"First of all, Dishoom had me at the name. We came to celebrate after getting engaged (!!!). We had initially tried to stop by for dinner on a weeknight around 9pm and the wait was 2 hours. I love me some Indian food but when a girl's hungry she can't wait that long for food. I'm glad we came back 'cause a late lunch at Dishoom was perfect, and we didn't have to wait! This has gotta be one of the swankiest Indian restaurants I've ever seen. Love the old Bollywood movie posters and vintage humorous ads on the walls. The mirrors above the kitchen are sexy. Even the bathrooms were decorated expertly. The food. Now, when I'm in London I always eat Indian food cause Indian food in America just doesn't compare. Dishoom is definitely one of the best Indian restaurants I've eaten at in London, and quite possibly the world - outside of my mama's kitchen, and of course, the Motherland. We had a terribly difficult time picking what we wanted to eat because everything sounded good. The pau bhaji was delicious. For something that is so simple, the chefs at Dishoom managed to elevate it into a spicy, sour, exciting appetizer. For entrees we ordered the Chicken Ruby and the Kacchi Lamb biriyani. The Chicken Ruby, Dishoom's version of tikka masala, was finger-lickingly divine, especially with a perfectly made roomali roti. The sauce was well seasoned and had just the right amount of butter. The Kacchi lamb biriyani (made Hyderabadi style) was on point. My Hyderabadi fiancé (!) verified its authenticity. The lamb was tender and moist and the rice was delicately flavored. You must get raita with biriyani, and this raita did not disappoint. Our server was very friendly and sweet. Prices are very reasonable for a London restaurant. When we left, full and happy, we saw a line of about 25-30 people waiting to enter for happy hour.  Overall, Dishoom deserves to take all my stars. The next time in London, I'll definitely be back."
8/5/2016,4 star rating,"Our server was very helpful. Great to go with 4 people and try new dishes to share. Everything we had was great, vegetarian somosas, ruby chicken, spicy lamb chops, chicken tikka and naan. Only downside is given how popular it is the wait can be unreal."
9/7/2018,5 star rating,Great overall experience.  Sat outside.  Great variety of options for vegetarians.  All four us were stuffed.  Service was very attentive.  Covent gardens is place to be.
21/12/2016,4 star rating,"Went here for an afternoon lunch on a Sunday (around 2-3pm) - quite a long wait of about 1 hour and 30 minutes. After about 45 minutes waiting outside in the cold, they bring you inside. You think that you've finally made it, but instead they give you a buzzer and sit you at the bar! Anyway - food-wise, it was phenomenal. Great authentic indian dishes - I don't recommend ordering both the curries as they are the same base (but one with chicken and the other one with paneer - I wish they had clarified this with us earlier). Otherwise, the curry on its own was great! The chicken-tikka wrap was mediocre, also - but everything else was fab. Small portions and relatively pricey, but thats what you get in return for the ambiance and beautiful decorations."
13/9/2015,5 star rating,Wow all I need to say is make sure you order the black dahl and the Ruby Murray curry! I was very lucky to have managed to get a table with some colleagues as there more than 6 of us. We had one of the booths in the basement and it was a really lovely spot. Want to come again with my bf but not sure if I can handle the idea of waiting for a table :)
28/6/2015,5 star rating,"This place has absolutely the best Indian food you can get in London. We were two people waiting for a seat on a Sunday afternoon and it took us around 30 mins to get one. We ordered a chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, a naan and a paav bhai (a heavier snack). All the dishes were delicious, I think I have never eaten better chicken tikka even in India. The service was courteous. I am going to this place again!"
17/3/2018,4 star rating,"Very good Indian food, in a well run, high volume operation. They have good cocktails, too. We had a variety of dishes, and all we're great. The only exception was the corn, which tasted great,but which was way overcooked. Make reservations well in advance."
2/5/2018,5 star rating,"Absolutely incredible Indian food.  I can't spell most of the stuff I ordered but it was all amazing.  I didn't think much of the cider when I first ordered it, but it actually pairs with the food incredibly well."
1/5/2016,4 star rating,"We came here around 5 pm on Sunday evening before seeing Thriller Live. At that time, the line wasn't so insane, so we waited about 30 mins outside and about 30 or so minutes at the bar once we got inside before getting seated. The drinks are awesome, the food is awesome, the service is awesome. The place definitely lives up to its hype, I just wish they took reservations for parties under 6 people! Definitely going back here tho !"
14/3/2018,1 star rating,"After a stellar experience 2 years ago I decided to visit today. Unfortunately the quality and experience of the food has dramatically dropped. It's now just another average Indian restaurant. The door staff was extremely rude and condescending. Overall, won't be coming back here again."
10/9/2016,5 star rating,"Fantastic flavours! Had the recommended Dal makhni, the chana bhatura and the amazing pista kulfi (because of which we walked in, in the first place). And of course my lassi. Loved the food, it was fresh, looked fantastic. We actually loved it so much that I had to go back to this place the next day. We tried the one in Covent Garden this time and again the food was great. We got biryani and vada pav, both tasting authentic. The pickled mirchi which came with the chana was outstanding. The lines were really long and the service was a bit slow but overall, good experience. Definitely try it out!"
5/9/2019,5 star rating,"Excellent cocktails. Ruby chicken was our favorite, then chicken tikka then black daal. Garlic naan was phenomenal, as were the lamb samosas. 100% recommend to anyone. Worth the long wait. Happy belly's here :)"
23/4/2018,4 star rating,"First off, the vibe is so amazing. I felt like i was eating at an outdoor Iranian cafe. It was relaxed and bohemian and fresh. I loved my dish (is was similar to chicken tikka masala). My hubby ordered a dish and was disappointed it wasn't saucy. We had an order or roti and garlic naan. It was delicious!"
5/4/2017,4 star rating,"Delicious Indian food in Covent Garden! There are great Indian options in London, but this restaurant really serves up a modern flair to some traditional classics // SERVICE // courteous and prompt // WAIT // 10 minutes at 9 PM On the weekend // FOOD //     + roti: chewy with a good bite, similar to naan     + Chicken tikka: tart and delicious, chicken was soft.     + Chicken ruby: never have had this before but the chicken was very tender and the roti was perfect for dipping!"
30/9/2015,3 star rating,"I wanted to love Dishoom so badly but it just let me down. I'd heard rave reviews from friends about how 'different' and delicious their brunch was, but what I got was glorified cheese on toast with very little chilli. It was lacking flavour and not particularly inventive (or well executed). My companions both had the omelettes which were also left lacking. After waiting 40 minutes for a table it was just a bit meh. The service was pretty good but couldn't make up for  the dreary food. Maybe save this one for dinner."
25/11/2018,1 star rating,I am really depending about my food and service. Terrible food too much expensive . Nothing special only spent money. I never come back again
19/6/2018,5 star rating,A fantastic and different place for breakfast and brunch. Everything we ordered was delicious and cooked perfectly. Service attentive but not overly so (which is nice). The place filled up quickly after opening so reserve a table or get there for doors open.
15/6/2018,5 star rating,"This is my first Indian meal in London and the quality of food, taste (of the naan and chicken ruby atleast that I had) was authentic and great to taste"
25/2/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing food. Great staff. The house chai is really good. I loved how fresh everything was, the fresh chili's were very delicious. The ruby chicken had large pieces of chicken breast that was very yummy. Definitely worth the wait. Go for lunch hours to beat the long hour+ wait though."
12/6/2018,4 star rating,Food and service were both excellent.  We went on a Tuesday night with three people.  Waited for 30 minutes at 5:20.   It was worth the wait!
23/3/2017,5 star rating,"In town on my birthday, I knew I wanted to eat some yummy Indian food. Did a quick search on Yelp and found Dishoom. 4.5 stars with over 800 reviews cannot be wrong so we headed over to wait in the que. We arrived just before 1800 on a Thursday and waited a total of 53 minutes for a table for two. We chatted with fellow travelers and enjoyed the complimentary chai tea we were served in line. Once we were seated, things moved quickly. Our waiter did an outstanding job. After we ordered, he made a few recommendations on how we could round out our meal and he was spot on.  Everything was delicious and easily some of the best Indian food I have had to date. Items were cooked to perfection and I loved the use of fresh herbs with our main entrées. We were able to try the Okra Fries £4.20, Spicy Lamb Chops £11.90, House Black Daal £5.90 (amazing!), Dishoom Chicken Tikka £7.90 and the Lamb Samosas £4.90. Everything here is done to the nines but the House Black Daal is necessary when you visit. The evening was perfect and I was very happy to celebrate my birthday here. Do yourself a favor and visit them if you are looking to enjoy an excellent meal."
19/10/2017,5 star rating,Wow! Been to India 2 times this place is legit! Best Chai I've had outside of India. Drinks are fantastic food is better. If you like Indian food this USA must go!
11/6/2018,5 star rating,Try the chicken ruby! The best Indian curry I have ever tried. I swipe every single drop of the sauce in the bowl with garlic naan that night. And other food is not at that level with dat RUBY.
24/3/2013,4 star rating,"Very cool Indian spot in Covent Garden! I heard a lot of good things about this place before I went but wasn't expecting it to be all nice and modern looking. Not really sure why, but I was thinking it was a hole in the wall and was completely thrown off when I came up on it. My large party was seated at one of the booths downstairs. We decided on ordering a whole bunch of different things and sharing it all and I highly recommend doing this so you can try as much as you possibly can. Some favorites I really enjoyed were the Dishoom Calamari, Masala Prawns, House Black Daal, & Chicken Tikka were all great. Save some room for dessert and get the Kulfi or Cinnamon Ice Cream. Service was quick and the food comes out fast! Can't beat that!"
20/2/2018,5 star rating,"BEST INDIAN RESTAURANT AND EXPERIENCE. We were seated at the bar while we waited for a table and the drinks were extremely well done. When we were seated, it was close to the man making the naan in the kitchen and it was so fun to watch him in action. The food and chutney was so good! We got the DISHOOM calamari, naan (plain and garlic), DISHOOM chicken tikka and prawn moilee. Can't say a single bad thing about any of the dishes because they were so good and they kept filling our chutneys."
3/10/2015,5 star rating,"I don't like queuing, especially for food when I'm hungry. BUT Dishoom is worth the wait. You can't book (unless for 6+ people) so we got there before 6pm to try and beat the dinner rush a little later. We were told the wait would be about 45mins but I think it was more like half an hour. They brought out complimentary hot chai to drink too. Once at the front of the queue we were then able to go down to the bar. We ordered cocktails and just before they were brought over to us, our buzzer went off to say our table was ready. A waitress carried our drinks upstairs for us, which was a nice touch. The staff are brilliant. Our waiter for the evening was Joseph and I can't speak highly enough of him. He was friendly, polite and attentive without standing over us. We eventually chose our dishes between the four of us - keema, paneer, chicken ruby, lamb tandoori, black dhal, rice and roti. They were good size portions and I love this way of eating as you get a bit of everything. The only problem is I wanted to eat ALL the food! There were some amazing flavours of great spices without it being overpowering, there was also no nasty burn! We then had a chocolate pudding with chilli ice cream to share as we were too full for dessert but couldn't resist it. It was rich and gooey and they ice cream was different. It was creamy vanilla with a delayed little kick of chilli at the end. Very nice and went well with the chocolate. Three of us had the Bolly Bellini cocktail, which was delicious. At £7.50 it's pretty standard pricing for London but it was one of the best I've had anywhere. A must get! One of my friends had a virgin cocktail and she ended up not drinking much of it. Joseph, the waiter, spotted this and asked her if she'd like something else instead and when she didn't he took her drink off the bill. Great service! I'll definitely be returning, even if I have to queue!"
17/4/2017,4 star rating,Good fusion of foods. A pricey given the type of foods served. Ambience is great.
9/7/2015,5 star rating,"Best Indian food I've had in a while. My co-workers have been raving about this place for weeks. The wait is scary, always long and down the street, but me and my friends waited less than we expected and were taken to the bar. Less than 5 minutes at the bar our table was ready, and the feast began. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. My favorites were the lamb samosas and the chicken ruby."
16/2/2018,5 star rating,"Holy moly Dishoom!  What can I say about Dishoom that hasn't already been said??  The absolute highlight of my visit to London culinarily.  Do not be turned off by the long lines at the door, they have the waiting down to a science.  Some reviews on here have suggested that the mandatory wait at the bar is a bit of a scam.  I don't know about you all, but when I go to dinner, I want to get down to eating as soon as possible.  Would much rather wait at their cozy bar with a tasty Bombay Martini and some appetizers than outside in the cold English night. I have been to each of their locations in London and walking in to the Indian music from the 60's and incense burning in the corner instantly transports you."
4/6/2016,5 star rating,"The best Indian food I have ever had! I was visiting London with my boyfriend. We came for a late dinner in Sunday, the staff graciously sat us even though the kitchen was closing in five minutes. Lifesavers! The food was incredible. Complex flavors in the dishes and excellently cooked chicken. We also came back to try out the naan breakfast rolls. I had mine with the Persian scramble. Hands down the best breakfast I have ever had. I will definitely be coming back next time I am in London."
28/5/2018,5 star rating,Don't let the line (queue for the Londoners) discourage you. This restaurant is well worth the wait. My main dish was the chicken ruby with the Roomali Roti and holy mother of pearl. I wanted a bucket of this curry to go. The spices (and hot spicy level) were on point / next level flavors. I'd go back in a heartbeat and would recommend this place to anyone traveling to London.
12/11/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing food and service, gets really busy during weekends so make sure you reserve a table in advance, Not your typical Indian. Highly recommended"
13/6/2015,5 star rating,"Really is as good as everyone says. Great food done in an imaginative way. Went with my partner and although we both loved the atmosphere as it had a real buzz about the place, can't help think it's probably best going with a larger group - perhaps not ideal for couples on a date!"
26/5/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing tasting food. Everything was delicious. It took awhile to get our bill. We got the lamb chops which were perfectly cooked, nice and tender. We also got the koliwada which was crunchy and had a beautiful blend of spices. We also received the cheese naan as well as the potato dish both we good. Lastly we got desert which was a perfect blend of chocolate sweet with a spicy scoop of ice cream. All in all excellent me definitely recommend."
8/8/2018,5 star rating,"This is the absolute best Indian food we have ever had! So flavorful and original! If you're wanting something like tikka Marsala or butter chicken, order the red curry. It's pretty much the same exact thing. The servers are friendly and helpful too! I only wish we had a Dishoom back in the States!"
12/11/2019,5 star rating,Awesome food. Great location and setup. Very nice and efficient staff. All time favorite for us. Never disappointed.
17/1/2017,5 star rating,"I've only had take away from here, all of the staff are nice, the food is tasty and ready very fast. I would strongly recommend. Take away is only available from mon-fri. Good lunch time menu."
4/10/2015,4 star rating,"I've only tried Dishoom for brunch and breakfast, the wait is always so long for dinner unfortunately. :-( I love the food, it's fresh and varied, and their breakfast naans are to die for!"
24/5/2018,5 star rating,Amazing suggested by a local and the chicken ruby was exactly what we wanted!!! We added rice which accompanied the sauce perfectly. We went to another local place but they didn't have a curry dish so we asked around and heard about Dishoom. I already recommended it to a friend that is visiting London!!!!
14/7/2013,3 star rating,"There were six of us which afforded us the luxury of reserving a table in advance. But even calling a month ahead only got us a reservation at 18:00! Nevertheless, I digress. We were seated in the dark lower level. Nice low lighting for an intimate dinner but it made for difficult reading of the menu. We managed to order a wide selection of food which was all delicious. Highlights were the tender lambchops, calamari, gunpowder potatoes, cheese toasts and the briyanis. The chutneys were also very good. The service felt pushy. They told us they needed our table back in 2 hours which was fine but the meal felt very rushed. They had us in and out in less than an hour. We ordered some samosas which arrived while we were still placing our order since it was being relayed wirelessly back to the kitchen.  Really? They couldn't wait until the waitress left our table to start bringing food out? I also felt the waitress was trying to suggestively upsell us along the way - would you like a lassi? Maybe a saucier dish to go with your meal? A trip to the loo also meant being accosted by staff and being herded in the right direction rather than being politely asked if I needed help.  I relayed this all back to the manager via email who was apologetic about the experience. I really enjoyed the food but the experience was not relaxing as the service was too in your face. The Shoreditch branch does a much better job in the delicate balancing act of turning tables and delivering a good service experience. The food serves 4 stars but the service really brings it down to 3."
5/11/2018,1 star rating,"Long queues, busy, noisy, dark and extremely crowded. Tables packed next to each other so you're practically sitting on the laps of the surrounding dinners. Very high prices. My idea of hell. But will suit those who just want to look ""trendy"", brag to their friends, and don't mind waiting in one hour long queues in the cold to have something to eat."
11/12/2017,5 star rating,"Oh man! We really to get unforgettable Indian food while in London. Boy, Dishoom did not disappoint! I literally have no pictures because we are everything before I remembered to take pics. First off they didn't take reservations but leave a pool of tables available for walk ups. While we waited in the queue, the hostess served us piping hot chai or mint tea since it was quite nippy out. Once you make it to the door, they take you down to the bar area so you can continue to wait for your table while having tasty drinks and snacks. The wait wasn't long; just long enough for one proper cocktail. Once at the table, we ordered straight away since we studied the menu while waiting in the queue. Appetizers included spicy corn like chips, veggie samosas and array of naan with dipping sauces. Gone in twenty secs. Main courses where chicken tikka with rice, lamb chops, and a grilled shrimp dish. Accompanied with a bowl of basmati rice, steamed veggies, and of course more naan. No one spoke. All we could do was make Sounds of delight as we devoured each dish. No one crumb was left. The spices were so flavorful and fresh. The heat factor was definitely present in very dish, but that is why they recommend the yoghurt condiment on the side. It was a swirl wind of flavors; some familiar, but some very foreign and pleasant.  Dishoom satisfies our Indian hankering ten fold!"
1/8/2018,5 star rating,Perfection. That's no hyperbole. Sheer perfection. From the hospitality to the impeccably made food. I can't rave enough. Get the Paneer wrap and thank me later.
3/11/2018,5 star rating,Didn't know Indian food could be this good! Arrived 5:30pm on a Friday and only needed to wait 10 minuntes for a table.
20/9/2015,5 star rating,"I would personally ensure that this never runs out of business if it opens in NY - I loved the food that much. Unlike, Indian fare in US, this restaurant actually has a very good chef. Black daal is  the second best I have ever had(Dal Bukhara ITC tops the list). Vada pav was amazing and remarkably light. My friend had the Keema Pav and Chicken Ruby. They don't take reservations. We got in around 6 and had no problems getting a table. This place is a must every time you are in London."
1/11/2018,5 star rating,One of my favourite restaurants to go to on special occasions. Nice atmosphere and great service
1/11/2018,4 star rating,"Before visiting London it kinda seemed like to place to go to. Long queue and so on... typical. But boy was it worth it. Amazing food, great service and beautiful interior. Not your prototype Indian restaurant, more street food like. Gotta try the Indian coke (thumbs up) too. Slight downer however was the standing in line for more than an hour and further waiting inside with a buzzer-device, felt more or less like mass processing. 4 Stars well deserved nevertheless."
11/10/2015,4 star rating,"Trendy and quality. I've eaten here several times and the food is always good, but the service is odd. They communicate via eearpiece which makes gives the impression of a mass-chain 'Garfunkles' type restaurant."
17/12/2019,5 star rating,Good value for what you are ordering. Long line ups. Prepare to wait +45 mins at any time of the day.
2/11/2017,5 star rating,"Dishoom has spoiled Indian food for me for the rest of my life.  In a good way.  I don't even like Indian food, but I knew I had to try Indian being in London, and this place did not disappoint. Great location in Covent Garden just down the street from Leicester Square tube station.  Kid/baby friendly (though they make you store your folding strollers/pushchairs at the front).  No wait without a reservation for a weekday lunch, but at dinnertime I saw queues outside starting at 5:30.  They had free chai for those in line to temper the wait though! Everything we had was absolutely delicious: * Rose Lassi with cardamom - so mild, fragrant, creamy and just lovely. * House Black Daal - their specialty!  the lentil dip is rich and flavourful * Lamb Boti Kabab - we had this with the black daal and raita; you can't go wrong with lamb in my books * Jackfruit Biryani - my favourite dish, the jackfruit added a bit of sweetness and was quite light * Raita - creamy and cooling mint/yogurt/cucumber sauce that went well with the lamb and jackfruit dishes * Chicken Ruby - tender chicken an a bit of a spicy kick * Garlic naan - nice and both chewy and crispy Prices were definitely reasonable.  Service was knowledgeable and quick.  Downside is that I will never be able to eat Indian food ever again because I now have impossibly high standards!"
11/5/2016,4 star rating,"FOOD WAS GREAT, SERVICE NEEDS A TAD BIT OF WORK I went to the one in East London. I thought the food was fantastic but was a bit annoyed with the waiter service. She was nice but we were waiting forever to get served. As a tourist on vacation, I expect to be served properly without waiting 20 minutes for them to take our order and having to flag down a waiter. Overall it's a really nice place with really good Indian food."
17/9/2017,5 star rating,"Daal is to die for. Some of the best service I have ever had. All around, an incredible experience."
2/11/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing food, Really spicy! The garlic naam bread and the chicken curry would make me come back if I could. Very nice place!"
2/11/2019,5 star rating,"Black daal, ruby chicken, okra fries and the Brest breakfasts in town. What more can you ask for?!"
1/3/2016,5 star rating,"The best Indian food I've ever had! My friend and I were in London on vacation, and I had heard about this place before, so we decided to try it! We arrived around 1:30 PM, and the hostess told us it would be about a 40 minute wait. She suggested that we wait at the bar. We both ordered drinks and some samosas. The Bollybellini. Was. AMAZING. So were the samoas!! After raving about how good the drinks were, we finally got seated. We ordered the Chicken Ruby, the Chef's special (it was shrimp in curry), rice, and naan. Everything was so delicious and filling- worth every penny! My friend had never had Indian food either, so this was a great first experience for her! The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the interior of the restaurant was just gorgeous. I would definitely go back if I ever happen to be in London again!"
16/7/2018,5 star rating,This place is worth the hype & the atmosphere/attention to detail is amazing.   Food is very good & so are the cocktails.
27/9/2013,4 star rating,"Lunch for six on 9/27/13. Really enjoyed the variety and theme of the restaurant. A place to get Katee rolls and Frankie's?  We were in heaven. Food hit the mark however service was a little off. We ordered the chicken and pomegranate salad but it was nicer delivered to the table. We had to remind them that it didn't come so that they could take it off the check. We ordered the rajma chawal for our kids so it came out first. When they delivered our food, they brought out a second rajma chawal which we didn't ask for. They took it back. A good concept of Indian street food in a refined setting. They take reservations until 6pm only."
14/7/2018,4 star rating,"Overall good experience. Wait time is always 30-45 min. But they make sure if you get a lemonade or chai while waiting. As soon as you get in, you dont get a table, you get a space at a bar. Then they call you for a table. They take your drinks to table and make you comfortable. Food was perfect. Had lamb samosa - tasty and lamb chops - very tasty. Mango lassi was ok. House chai is must have at the end of a meal. Choices are limited so make sure you check a menu online first and then come. If looking for something fancy indian dish, you will be disappointed. Drinks are of variety. Need to come again to try-'em all. I would come here again."
20/4/2017,5 star rating,"I recently have come to really like Indian food, so going to Dishoom while in London was a must. My friend and I stood in line for a half hour, but I came in knowing there'd be a long queue. The staff knew too, and were equipped with complimentary sherry and chai tea for the guests in the queue. We were led downstairs to the bar where we ordered drinks first. My friend got an old fashioned and I had a blended orange drink. We were both very satisfied with our choices! Soon we were led to our table and we ordered a bunch of food- lamb biryani, ruby chicken curry, house black daahl, garlic naan, roti, okra fries with incredible dipping sauce and a side of basmati rice. Oh my god. So good. Everything was absolutely amazing. I wouldn't change a thing the next time we come to Dishoom, the curries were rich and flavorful, the lamb biryani was excellent, the lamb was SO tender, the daahl was the perfect balance between the two. Truly an experience and I can't wait to come back!!"
6/8/2019,5 star rating,"I mean it's solid. Don't know what else to say. The best dishes are the Ruby Chicken, no question the Chili Chicken, the spicy lamb chop is very good and not really spicy in my opinion, the naan is solid, and pretty much every special dish is very good."
28/2/2017,4 star rating,I had brunch here. Beware that brunch is until 11.00 (I think) and there is a long queue. So go early to make sure you get in there in time. I had the sausage roll which was really good. I def recommend going!
27/4/2018,4 star rating,"Who knew London would have such authentic and excellent Indian food?! This was my first time in London. A friend picked this restaurant. I would give five stars if our wait wasn't so long (about an hr and a half on a Monday night), but we were able to sit on the patio and order drinks from the bar while we waited. The food was literally amazing!! We had garlic naan, jackfruit biryani, paneer masala and mixed green vegetables. The cocktails were great as well! I will definitely revisit the next time I return to London!"
31/1/2017,4 star rating,"I was worried this was just a hype and got abit fidgety in the queue. But yes, the hype is true, its awesome food. Very creative, very tasty. Dishoom is a well oiled machine with polite staff and great seating surroundings."
30/4/2015,5 star rating,"Since moving to London three months ago, I have visited Dishoom on three occasions (twice for dinner and once for brunch), and they have all have been great experiences!! My friends visiting from Texas and LOVED it. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted by multiple people before getting seated. Our food was delicious (especially the Black Dahl and Garlic Naan!) The chicken ruby is also a must! Would definitely recommend this place to anyone that passes through London. Great sharing portions and great vibes for a group of friends."
7/10/2018,5 star rating,"great atmosphere, amazing food, best cocktails and really good service. Have been to Dishoom many times, and keep coming back every time."
24/3/2017,4 star rating,"I got here at 5pm on a Saturday night without a reservation and was told there was about 70 minute wait. Crazy, but the line kept getting longer behind me so I figured it was a good sign. They kept bringing out chai for the people in line too, which was really nice -- plus, I actually got inside into the bar after about 40 minutes, and actually seated maybe 15 after that. They definitely have their system down, which I appreciated. The food and service were all really good. Everything I tried was great, so I don't think you can go wrong with anything, but definitely check out the dishes highlighted on the menu in the little boxes -- I had the pau bhaji and house daal and loved the flavors in both. For main I went with a ""boring"" choice, chicken tikka, but it too was really great, with all of the flavors in perfect combination."
16/4/2018,5 star rating,I loved Dishoom. The atmosphere is great and the food is amazing! You will not be disappointed.
16/4/2018,5 star rating,"The best Indian restaurant in London, which arguably makes it the best Indian restaurant in the world."
30/9/2016,4 star rating,Lovely food!!! Service can take a little while though at busy times. Breakfast is a winner!! Cocktails armed top too!
22/4/2015,5 star rating,"The great interior space provides a true feeling of an Indian Cafe with a very casual feel which makes it ideal for an amazing breakfast experience or a laid back lunch.. The service is attentive but not intrusive so you can easily even hold meetings here (as i seen some people do) but i would recommend to either save it for dates & casual dining with friends. You can easily eat for two here for under a tenner but I would highly recommend trying a few of the more unusual things on the menu. If you want something simple for breakfast the house granola is the best i ever had and all the dishes i tried are freshly prepared & provide a great healthy but filling breakfast. As for lunch if you like indian food, you are going to love Dishoom. The House Chai is a cardamom flavored milky tea and it's amazing, as is the Chai Chocolate, both of which you can have with dipping toast. Whenever i pass by and i don't have time to sit in I always get a chocolate chai for takeaway :)"
11/4/2018,5 star rating,"Best Indian food I've ever had. You will stand in line but it is totally work the wait. We tried the prawns the Mahi, calamari, and chicken in a tomato sauce. All were fantastic. Great cocktails and atmosphere as well. Try to go early so you aren't stuck waiting for 2 hours."
11/4/2018,5 star rating,"Fantastic. The que outside almost scared us away, but it was well worth the 45 minute wait. We actually went back about two days later while on our tour of London. The food is amazing but honestly I was in awe of how well this the restaurant was managed. Their systems in place and training is some of the best I've ever seen. This is one of the best all around restaurants I've ever been to."
4/2/2018,5 star rating,"I've always seen the queues in front and wondered what the hype is and finally had the opportunity tonight to learn first hand. The food is truly outstanding. I've always been a fan of Indian food and thought we had some great options in LA and an occasional visit to an Indian place in Manchester or London, however this is a fresh take on the real deal. Very inventive while still embracing the authentic tastes. I ordered the Mahi Tikka along with Pau Bhaji which was just absolutely perfect. I tried sampling as much as I could without overstuffing myself. Don't skip the Paneer Roll and of course an order of Naan. Everything on the menu looked amazing. I would say its perhaps the best food I've had in London in a long time!"
21/6/2018,1 star rating,"Oh my. I thought Indian food sucked in the US, but eating here made me realize that the food back home isn't that bad. Ordered a chicken curry and a daal dish. Both seem to have similar flavors. Ordered rumali roti which was basically a regular roti just a bit skinnier and bigger but should not be called rumali. Anyways, if you want flavor and spice don't come here. If you want color and the feeling that you are eating borderline Indian food, sure ..."

28/2/2017,4 star rating,"I went to the Covent Garden after King's Cross, so it felt that the place was too small compared to the other one. (Especially with all the people who want to go here... lol) We waited for about an hour for dinner and the wait was worth it! You can see the naan being prepared and cooked in the kitchen and of course they were amazing. Personally love the garlic naan! The ruby chicken is my favorite!"
27/10/2017,5 star rating,"This was without a doubt the best Indian food I have ever had. There is a wait of about half an hour, but it is definitely worth it. The food was perfect, and reasonably priced considering it is downtown London. The waiter also brought out an extra dish at no charge, which was awesome! I would definitely recommend visiting this place if you are in London. It really made our trip awesome!"
17/6/2018,5 star rating,Best indian i have ever had. If there is a line outside make the right choice like we did and wait.
30/8/2019,5 star rating,"We would wait in a ""queue"" twice as long to eat at Dishoom again!  Excellent food in a lively atmosphere.  The cheese toast appetizer was amazing, as was the Chicken Ruby.  And he gin & tonic was the best cocktail I ever had!"
16/9/2018,3 star rating,Not what I expected. Didn't like the decor or the food. I am very generous and always give the benefit of the doubt but felt like they wanted us out if there as it was nearing closing time but then they should adjust their timings not rush paying customers. To top that our order was wrong and told them mild coz of my young child and the food cane our spicy. Not going there again.
15/11/2015,5 star rating,"When friends visit London and ask me for a food recommendation, I tell them to go to Dishoom. Dishoom is an iconic London restaurant for a reason. The cocktails are impressive and always worth getting (I love me a Bombay Pimms or a Chaijito), the service is great, and the food is incredible. Some of my favorites are: - Black daal: a must - Chicken ruby: another must - Dishoom calamari - Roomali roti - Chai (duh) Surprisingly not my favorite: - Chocolate chai Tip: Come at an odd time, otherwise you'll be queueing for a while (but at least they give you free chai -- or sherry! -- while you wait)."
14/9/2015,4 star rating,"The food was VERY good here (or maybe it was the result of finally eating after our hour-45 minute wait). We got the Black House Daal (lentils), Chicken Ruby, Spicy Lamb Chops, a garlic and a plain naan - 3 of us. Each dish was so flavorful, rich and served hot! (which I love). The Chicken Ruby (4 pieces) is the second best chicken I have ever eaten - so tender and juicy. The Spicy Lamb Chops (3 pieces) with pomegranate was so good we ordered a second 2/3's into our meal. I would definitely give Dishoom 5-stars if it weren't for the wait. For the foreigners (Americans) who dine here: (since the host said 75% of the people who eat here are foreigners) - the wait is long! the host said the shortest wait times are before 5:30pm - there is free wifi in line and in the restaurant - the hosts are friendly and pass out free House Chai to the line - reservations are only permitted for parties of 6+ - the waits are just as long at other Dishoom locations (we checked out the King's Cross location the day before and the wait was just as long) - but inside, the service and ambiance are great"
1/10/2015,4 star rating,I think I'm addicted to the squid. I love asian food and a lot of the main dishes are solid 7/10's but the chilli squid and bacon naan roll (morning breakfast) are stand out dishes. The cocktails are actually very good too. It's definitely a fusion of East meets west eventhough it is portrayed as Bombay cafe. The decor is a lovely feature of this place in a world that seemingly nowadays. Overall I'm glad they have opened more branches. Hopefully not TOO many but it's refreshing to see Indian cuisine represented in this way with good quality to match.
27/2/2017,5 star rating,We ordered everything on the dang menu. Everything was super tasty and very flavorful. Not the cheapest food but the food doesn't disappoint. Wish they opened one up in LA.
4/8/2015,5 star rating,"Hands down my favourite restaurant in London - the Black Daal is a must There will be a que if your going for dinner but do not walk away, you will regret it!"
5/6/2015,5 star rating,"Amazing Indian food!! Much better than anything I've had in New York or Boston. Firstly, Dishoom is a ""new bombay style"" Indian restaurant. I don't know exactly what this means but it is hip and trendy inside, not a mom and pop Indian place. However, despite this, the food tastes authentic and the clientele was about 50% Indian. We went here on a Friday night and it was so packed. First, we waited outside for about an hour. However, they kept bringing us brandy and hot chai tea so we didn't mind so much since we were having a great time drinking. Then, we were escorted to the bar area to wait where we ordered drinks and could have ordered appetizers if we wanted. And lastly, we were escorted to our table. Waited about 1 hr 45 mins in total. However, this was probably the most enjoyable long wait I have ever had for a table. Dishoom is organized and everything is electronic. Everyone knew my name and exactly how long I had waited for a table. It was quite a pleasant experience. I can't remember the names of the drinks we had but they were delicious. I also especially loved the hot spiced chai tea we had when we waited. Would definitely recommend ordering the chai tea. To eat, we had the garlic naan, chicken ruby, and black daal. I don't even like dark meat chicken but I loved the chicken ruby! It is very similar to chicken tikka masala but it has a unique flavor and I think is event better. The black daal was incredible and so buttery and filled with flavor. The food came out extremely quickly so even though we waited a long time for the table, we were eating within 10 minutes of sitting down. For dessert, we had some type of mango granola pudding that was also incredible. Definitely, definitely visit here. It is a unique experience you can't get anywhere else!"
23/7/2017,5 star rating,"This place is a must if you're in London.  My wife and I were in town for a long weekend a few months back and made sure to come here after reading all of the good reviews.  It was so good, we ended up going back again 2 days later.  This was hands down some of the best Indian food we've ever had.  The wait is always really long, but it's definitely worth it.  The staff also gives out free chai tea and sherry since the wait is usually 40+ minutes.  Everything here is delicious, and over the 2 nights that we ate here, we enjoyed the grilled masala prawns, garlic naan, chole bhatura, chicken tikka, butter-bhutta corn, gunpowder potatoes, okra fries, fried calamari, pineapple pepper crumble, and chocolate pudding with chili.  The drinks are good too and I recommend the Dishoom IPA and Viceroy.  Highly recommend this place if you're in London and are craving delicious Indian food."
4/6/2018,5 star rating,Best meal we had the entire time we were in London. Highly recommend this place to ANYONE. I wasn't the biggest fan of curry going into this place but boy was I wrong! Every single thing we tried was delicious but our favorite by far was the calamari dipped in the green chutney they served. IF YOU GO TO LONDON EAT HERE. Make a reservation though. The line was quite long for those who hadn't made one.
4/6/2016,5 star rating,"Simply the best restaurant I've ever been to. There was a long line outside and we were told we'd wait around an hour and a half, but we only wound up waiting around 40 minutes. So, for those of you discouraged by the crowd gathered outside, fear not. Granted we had a party of two. Food here was relatively cheap for the quality. I got the chicken ruby, which was tender and spicy, but not overly so. The sauce was delicious and I dipped my garlic naan in it after I was done with the chicken. The naan was soft, but may be too thin for some people. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. He shared some stories with us, which would usually be annoying but he was just a genuinely nice guy. He brought us raika for free to the table, which was creamy and tangy and paired well with the lamb biryani my mother got. Overall a great experience!!"
16/3/2015,5 star rating,"The place to go for Indian in London. Went around 8pm on a Sunday evening and line was out the door. We we're told 30 minutes until we'd get inside to the bar, where we can order a drink and wait another 10-15 min till being seated. We decided to wait and thank god we did. We waited 15 minutes outside before going in, got to the bar to order a drink and within less than 5 minutes were given a table! I suppose they overestimate waiting time to avoid complaining customers, understandable. Food - absolutely delicious and I'm not a huge Indian cuisine consumer. We ordered the Ruby Chicken, Black Daal, Chicken Tikka, Basmati Rice, Pau Bhaji, Lamb Boti Kabab and Garlic Naan. Everything was delicious and very flavourful. Service - waiter was extremely helpful in suggesting different plates and the right amount. Also helped with understanding the flavours of each dish. Drinks - ordered the chilli martini which was sweet and delicious! Too stuffed for dessert, but based on the entrees I can predict its nothing short of amazing as well. Recommend to others visiting London."
11/7/2015,5 star rating,"OK, hype or no hype this restaurant was every bit as good (if not better) as it was built up to be. Where do I start? Our table on the terrace was Position A for people watching. And people watching we did (I'll get back to this in a second). The bar makes beautiful drinks and we had many. The menu is just mesmerizing. It's like an old colonial restaurant's menu in Bombay India. So tantalizing you want to order everything. We started with an almost sweet and sour fried calamari. Wow was it good. I could have ordered two more of these puppies and called it a day. We had their specialty of the house which is called black house daal and is a curried lentil dish that is out of this world. Ordered with garlic naan it is scrumptious. A chicken salad and a few more beers and this was a lunch to remember. The atmosphere is charming! Not taking itself to seriously it has great old school colonial art, writings on the walls that is humorous and very Indian. I went downstairs where the kitchen and yet another bar is. Charming is all I can say. The service is top notch, but that brings me back to the people watching; so our young attractive waitress was taking such good care of us, but then this super good looking guy comes in and takes a seat right next to us. This young man turned every females head in the entire restaurant. My wife (who is old enough to be this boys mother) lost her breath. Our waitress was so gaga'ed by this ""HUNK"" she was worthless from that point on. I'm not going to lower this five star review due to some primal instinct. That's not fair to Dishoom. This was a culinary high point of our trip to England. We are so happy we ate here. BTW, he was gorgeous!"
17/1/2018,5 star rating,"I've only been to this location for breakfast but at 11am on a Thursday it was already pretty busy. And for good reason - the food is absolutely delicious. We ordered the sausage naan roll (my favorite), kejriwal, bun maska and chai. The portions are just right and all the food was cooked perfectly. The waiter was also very attentive and was alway quick to refill the chai. Very clean and bright interior."
17/1/2016,5 star rating,"I've been to a few Indian restaurants in the U.S., but none of them has ever come close to Dishoom. A friend and I had to wait in line for 45 minutes on a Monday night when I was in London. During the wait, they handed out some hot water with mint as it was chilly and raining in London that night. As soon as we were seated, they took our orders. The food here is served tapas style (small plates that can be shared amongst your party). 1) Chicken Ruby - It is very similar to chicken tikka masala. It has a delicious, creamy tomato-based sauce that is very flavorful. Hands down, one of the best dish Indian dishes I've had in my life. 2) Black House Daal - Although this dish was flavorful, it didn't stand out to me as much, probably because it was overshadowed by the other dishes we ordered. 3) Vegetable biryani - I think the biryani could have used some more flavor. I personally didn't think there was anything special about this dish. I would assume their lamb biryani is tastier, and I would definitely order that instead when I come back. 4) Mattar Paneer - The tomato-sauce base is very similar to the Chicken Ruby's, but with panner and vegetables instead of chicken. My friend is a vegetarian and really enjoyed this dish; highly recommended for the vegetarians. 5) Garlic Naan - The naan is crispy on the edges and chewy, soft, and buttery on the inside, just the way I like my naan. They definitely does not skimp out on the garlic flavor of the naan. It is delicious! I would book a flight to London today just for this if I could. 6) House Chai - The perfect balance of sugar, spice, and everything nice in one hot drink, perfect for a chilly London evening. I would definitely come back to Dishoom when I visit London again."
11/11/2016,4 star rating,"Good food and a great change from the usual curry houses. The dishes have a slight eastern influence especially from Iran, which makes me a bigger fan. My only gripe is the queue, where you cant leave your name and come back. The gunpowder potatoes are great as are the lamb chops. Good drinks and good service, every time i have been there."
1/6/2018,5 star rating,"The atmosphere was great, the service was beyond accommodating. We had a big party and they were able to fit us in quickly and went out of their way to take care of us. The food was delicious! I recommend the lamb biryani, and everyone I was with was more than pleased with their food. Service + Food = A++++++++"
18/3/2018,5 star rating,"Holy moly this place is great. We arrived in London a little later, got there around 9.45 and only needed to wait 30 minutes for a table (normally is 2ish hours). We were served delicious hot chai in line and then guided down to the bar where we had a very friendly bartender make delicious cocktails. Once we were seated, service was attentive and friendly. We ordered the lamb samosas (must have!), dishoom chicken (another must have!), chicken ruby and the signature bean sauce. Everything was delicious- this place definitely lived up to the hype!"
25/3/2015,5 star rating,"I understand some folks may think this place is a bit too polished or caters too much for the Anglo-Saxon pallet, but who cares if it's freakin' great? On a recent business trip to London I visited this place twice and would be going there for lunch right now if I wasn't 5,000 miles away. =( The Dishoom Chicken Tika was superb in both its tenderness and spiciness. If you like Chicken Tikka Masala then you can do no better by ordering the Chicken Ruby. The spicy richness of this curry dish was sublime, and far more complex than most Indian joints reach for. Two thumbs up in my book. Not to be left out is the House Black Dal, which being from Texas, reminded me of meatless chili. But I mean that in the best way possible. It was fantastic and I could not get enough of it. Their roti was fine, however the naan was by far not the best I've ever had. That said, I didn't come to Dishoom for bread. The decor of the place is pretty classy and if there's a line, which there will be on most evenings it seems, don't be afraid of it. Just wait it out as the food comes quickly and the line moves rather swiftly. In summary, Dishoom = Boom, goes the dynamite."
20/5/2015,5 star rating,"For those of you not familiar with Dishoom, it's a restaurant styled in homage to the Irani street food cafés which make up Bombay. I've been to Dishoom for dinner, which is great. but for the purpose of this review - let's talk breakfast! There's three across London (Covent Garden, Shoreditch and Kings X), I went to the one in Kings Cross branch. The building itself is beautiful and one of the largest in London. In what used to be a transit shed, the restaurant has been built to include cobble floor from the original stables with exposed wrought iron beams and high ceilings. Black and white photos and memorabilia adorn the walls much the style of its now trademark style. The breakfast food is outrageously good but there was only ever one dish for me - the bacon naan roll. I'd heard great things about it and it did not disappoint! The bacon was spot on for me - I like my bacon erring on the rubbery side but with a slight crisp  - and the naan was soft, fluffy yet slightly charred. All this coupled with the sweet and tangy chilli jam made me one very happy customer! Other dishes on the menu include akuri - spicy scrambled eggs and kerjriwal - fried eggs on chilli toast. Both, i'm told, are delicious but nothing comes close to that bacon naan!"
7/1/2015,5 star rating,"Dishoom serves up some of the best Indian food I've ever had. The mango lassi. My god. Maybe it was dehydration from walking around all day, but nothing was better than mango lassi at that particular moment. Smooth, creamy, dare I say... mangoey? We tried a number of dishes, but the stand out was most certainly the grilled lamb chops. The flavor was on point - perfectly grilled and topped off with pomegranate seeds. The naan was warm and fluffy and the coleslaw served as a perfect cool down when necessary. I wouldn't have changed anything we ordered, except perhaps add on a tandoori chicken because I got major food envy looking at the table next to ours. I'd recommend making a reservation if possible, but if you end up waiting, you have to queue up outside. They come outside with drinks to keep you happy, but it looks a bit miserable especially if it's freezing cold outside."
9/5/2015,4 star rating,"I'm now officially obsessed with this place having come for breakfast two Saturdays in a row, lured by the Keema Per Eedu. It's a decadent mixture of chicken mince, delightfully spiced, accompanied by chicken livers and topped with two runny eggs and crunchy potato sticks. My usual approach is to squeeze in a bit of lime juice, then put a yolk and a few healthy spoonfuls into a pau bun. The dish is really flavorful, and the spices leave you mouth tingling. A swig of house chai will confoundingly heighten the spice for a second before cooling the fires and preparing you for your next bite. It borders on too much food, so rich, but is clearly my new crush. Oh, and by the way, the husband and three kids also come along but it's more about me than them. Booking for breakfast makes seating for a family of five a breeze. My kids (ages 3, 7, 9) are well fed from selections like Fire Toast (thick, hearty slices of lightly charred toast and interesting jams), Bun Maska (a fluffy bun, split and buttered, served with chai), house porridge (never-ending portion and flavored of banana and dates), house granola and fruit and yogurt. My husband's tried the Big Bombay and the Bacon Roll on naan. I'm just enamored with Dishoom and now working up the courage to wait in line one evening for dinner."
17/3/2019,1 star rating,There was so much hype about Dishoom that I wanted to check it out. I have traveled all over the world and have tried the best of Indian foods -- the claim they make that Dishoom has best Indian food is a joke. There is a limit on how good Indian food could be given the limited number of spices. People stupidly wait an hour and a half to taste samosa that is no better than any street food. They use a gimmick to fool people by using anglo-Indian names for Indian dishes. People wait for hours in god foresaken weather to eat what I consider to be average Indian food. It is time someone brings this place down -- don't go by the hype. Save yourself from getting sick in this weather and go somewhere else. Trust me they are not good. Avoid this place like the plague.
23/8/2015,5 star rating,"Great food! Nice atmosphere! Friendly service. Chicken Ruby was delicious, but the Lamb lollipops were amazing. It had wonderful flavor. Wish we could've stopped by more time than once during our 4.5 days in London."
27/9/2017,4 star rating,"We went early but there was a short line, which was made pleasant with complementary mint tea or chai. We tried vada pau, mattar paneer and the prawn special, which was my favorite with a buttery cream sauce and cilantro. All great with rice or Naam bread."
21/8/2013,4 star rating,"Entrance: Arrived around 8pm on a Saturday without a reservation. We were told the wait would be around an hour, but as there was no space at the bar downstairs yet, we had to queue outside. There wasn't any option to leave our name and return later either. This was by far the most entertaining queue I'd been in. First, they brought out hot milk tea for all of us. Then, the guy at the door asked us if we wanted to see some magic. He did a few tricks (found a card we picked, made a lighter disappear - this was particularly amusing as the lighter fell out of his sleeve a moment later) and while far from the best, his personality combined with the tricks made it very entertaining. Shortly after, we were let into the bar area. Bar: Managed to get some stools at the corner so we were comfy. There isn't much space at the bar area so I can see why they were full. Tried the dishoom ipa and thoroughly enjoyed it. We also ordered lamb samosas and calamari. The samosas were excellent but pricey for the portion (2 pieces for 4.2 pounds). Food: We ordered the Murgh Malai Chicken, Roomali Roti, Black Daal, Chicken Berry Brittania Biryani, and Raita. This order was just nice for 2 people (we actually doubled up on this as there were 4 of us). Everything was amazing! My one complaint might sound a bit weird but it's that the carb:protein ratio in the biryani felt a bit skewed towards protein. It might be because we added an additional chicken dish as well but it just felt like the dish as a whole was getting overpowered by the meat. I solved the problem for myself by giving some extra chicken to one of my friends. And I imagine for most people this won't really be a cause for complaint. Service: Prompt, attentive, friendly. And this covers everyone from the door to the bar to the table. Loved our server in particular. He was incredibly high energy. Dessert: I had the Mango Kulfi and tried a bite of the chocolate mousse. Tasty but nothing special. A slight let down given the high quality of the mains. Overall: Loved it! Already looking forward to the next visit. As I'm writing all this, I'm not even sure myself why I'm not giving it a 5. It just seemed to fall short somewhere (though I'm not sure where), but this is definitely at the top end of a 4 for me. (I really need yelp to be out of 10...)"
29/12/2017,5 star rating,"Excellent Indian with some Middle Eastern flares.  Comfortable atmosphere.  Very attentive service.  The Garlic naan and Chicken we our favorites.  We usually less than favor even some of the best considered Indian restaurants in California/US but, much like other similar establishments in London, we  always find London offers in this category to be always closest to original/genuine-authentic and tasty.  TIP:  make reservations or possibly prepare to wait 1-1.5 hours to get in!  On a cold winters might you may decide to not wait that long!"
15/8/2018,4 star rating,"The wait at this place was ONE HOUR!! They do give you small drinks while you wait (lemonade, sherry, chai), which is nice. The staff gets to you very quickly, which is nice. Ordered the Behl, which was strangely addicting. The Dahl was also very good. Spicy Lamb was good, but my chop was over cooked. Chicken Tikka roll was very amazing, but it's a wrap, not a roll. Chicken curry was also delicious. Roti was good, but I was craving naan a little more. Chicken tikka looked good, but as far as I could tell it was just grilled chicken (did not try). They don't ask if you want a dessert menu, which was nice and odd at the same time. I'm not used to restaurants doing that. The bathroom has an unnecessary amount of stairs (you walk up 2 stairs to get in and 1/2 the br is another 2 steps down... make it flat!!!). Overall good food, tho wait might not be worth it."
15/8/2010,4 star rating,"Dinner at Dishoom might have been my favorite meal during my visit to London.  Not the finest food, nor the most striking ambiance, and not even exceptional service... but a flawless balance of the above that set it apart from all the rest. Although it was a bit of a slow start (is 1800 hours early for dinner in the UK?), servers seemed to be a challenge to flag down.  Once we snagged one, however, cocktails and dishes came fast and furious with a rapid pace that kept up with my appetite. Each dish after another was more and more delicious.  Particular favorites for me were the lamb biryani with raita, the chicken curry, and the garlic naan that I couldn't get enough of.  I can't quite put my finger on how British Indian food differs from Indian food in India - higher quality ingredients or a different spice combination, perhaps.  Whatever it is, it works superbly. Without a doubt, I'd come back again.  At roughly £20 a head, I wouldn't consider this a cheap meal, but considering it included a drink and walking out feeling stuffed to the gills, I call it a right fair value."
21/9/2017,5 star rating,"Worth the wait. We went on a Wednesday evening and waited 1.5 hours but we were able to spend the last hour at the bar having drinks and snacks. The cocktails were great, the food was amazing and less spicy than described, which for me was a pleasant surprise. Even the dessert was good!!"
14/8/2018,5 star rating,"Hand's down my favorite Indian place. High quality, fair prices, it's authentic and a treat every time."
12/10/2017,5 star rating,Better than expected. Will absolutely be back on my next visit to London. Hey Dishoom - come to Seattle please!!!!!! The people here only think we have good Indian. I thought so too. Until I had you. I had no idea what I was missing.
9/5/2018,5 star rating,"This place is just as good as all the reviews say it is. I'm from Manhattan and have been to many Indian places over the years. Our server was Alin who gave outstanding suggestions. We had the lamb samosas to start, large Kingfisher beer, and we split the lamb chops, House Daal, plain naan, and Tikka wraps. Finished it up with the coffee Martini. I have a dairy allergy and they willingly adjusted the drink to fit. Overall outstanding. Would highly recommend to anyone trying to find amazing Indian food in London. Would absolutely make a reservation ahead of time Bc it fills up very quickly. Cheers!"
11/8/2016,5 star rating,Delicious dishes and a great friendly service when with my friend for her birthday they gave us complimentary drinks and were very friendly! Well worth a visit. We went at lunch time and it was nice and quiet.
11/8/2019,5 star rating,Amazing! The wait is worth the great food and service. Recommend getting a reservation if any are still available for the time you desire.
27/9/2019,5 star rating,One of my most favorite Indian restaurant in London! I loved the potato chilli! Food is awesome.
20/4/2011,4 star rating,"Obviously more expensive than you'd find in Whitechapel or along Brick Lane but still totally good value for money! And wonderful if you don't want to smell like curry after your meal. I once dined at Dishoom twice in a week, that's how good this Bombay-inspired eatery is. Situated in Covent Garden, it's super central and good for groups up to six but beyond that be prepared to split up. Not to be missed: pau bhaji and the lamb biryani (make sure to pair with raita!) I'm hoping someday soon to join the Bombay Breakfast Club (yup, Dishoom's open in the morning!) Bacon naan roll, anyone?"
14/10/2018,5 star rating,"Best Indian food anywhere! The jackfruit biryani, okra fries, the bacon and egg naan roll! The food is amazing and there is an honesty in this amazing food. Go stand in line, it's worth the wait!"
2/7/2019,5 star rating,Love this place..food a bit on the saltier side for my tate..reminds me of 90' Bombay
14/12/2017,5 star rating,"I love Indian food and know that London has some great Indiana restaurants, so I really wanted to indulge while visiting. My husband is not much of a fan, but he was willing to tag along. When we got to the restaurant, there was a line outside (in December--brrr) with an hour wait time quoted, and we decided to wait for a table (at least they serve tea and chai while you're waiting!). Well, the food was phenomenal and well worth freezing our tails off! My husband liked the food, so there's hope for him yet . However, if you are looking for a quiet place to dine, you will want to steer clear."
1/2/2011,5 star rating,"Indian tapas has arrived, in it's true Mumbai form! I had heard of this place through the interwebs and started to follow them on Twitter. Any company that engages with their customers well and makes you feel like part of the family has two thumbs up from me! They're really friendly and always up for a tweet or two, and if you're lucky you might get an invite for some free chai! The food was mouth-watering...in fact my mouth is watering right now as I think back to the Pau Bhaji and Chicken Tikka dishes - mmmmmm. Their naan's are made to perfection; soft with a slight crisp and no need to chew for 10 mins before you can move on to the next bite! The Tipples (cocktails) are genius! I had a Bhang lassi and if you're of the Indian kind you'll just have had a Scooby ""huuuuh"" moment. It's lassi with a generous amount of Rum and garnished with mukwaas! Delish! I cannot wait to their breakfast menu one of these days and i'll definitely be visiting again....this month in fact!"
5/2/2018,4 star rating,"Went for breakfast, super yummy. Great Chai too. J keep meaning to make this my breakfast work spot, particularly the Carnaby street location as it's rather large, but it's always a wee bit too far away. Shame."
19/4/2018,4 star rating,"Great meal in London as advertised.  Had the chicken tikka and lamb samosas and both were very good.  Note that portions are not that large, but neither are prices considering what they could charge given the line down the block.  I was seated before 5 though, and had no issues getting a table.  Definitely recommended."
6/6/2017,4 star rating,"Great street food concept.  Food was good, and the place filled up fast around noon.  What I didnt enjoy so much was the chicken roomali roti, thought was too sweet.  The samosas and chole bature were good but the chole could have been a bit more robust/spicy."
12/8/2010,4 star rating,"Yay! I'm a fan. I think this phrase pretty much sums up my experience at Dishoom the other night. To be honest, I didn't expect much from a restaurant in this location, where usually only restaurants exist that cater to tourists who are afraid to try anything beyond their comfort zone.   In fact, the restauran would somehow be not misplaced on my (imaginary) list of places-that-are-too-corporate-and-thus-loose-out-on-authenticity...however...despite the quite standardised service and the corporate look, I was feeling well-taken care of, attended to by the waiting staff and showered with delicious Indian food.   Speaking of the food: I loved it that we were able to order tapas-like food that was tiered up on the table on what I would like to call a table-ladder. We ordered a wide assortment of dishes and the dishes I remember most vividly were the vegetable samosas, the buttered-bread with creamed vegetable-sauce and the char-grilled vegetables...yummy! Having said all this: I still prefer the kinds of restaurant that don't need an entire marketing team to thrive (but will excel simply because of word-of-mouth propaganda). Nevertheless, like I said I was pleasantly surprised by Dishoom and will definitely be back when I have visitors that don't want to go out to the dodgy (yet really authentic) places, but prefer a restaurant with clean toilets, non-greasy tables and efficient service."
23/6/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing food!  Great service. The queue was long, but went quickly. Hostess said it would be about 40 minutes and it wasn't more than 10. Regardless, worth the wait."
13/4/2018,5 star rating,My husband and I wanted to try this restaurant based on its yelp reviews and we were not let down. This was the best Indian food that we've ever had. Ever.
15/9/2017,5 star rating,"Breakfast at Dishoom is a must! Their naan rolls are the best way to start the day (I'm torn between bacon and egg vs. sausage and egg, so I tend to switch off between the two each time I visit). For lunch/dinner, their gunpowder potatoes shouldn't be missed, and their raita is phenomenal. Pro tip: skip the chai, make note that their biryani dishes are a bit dry, and be aware that the food is spicier than expected (although this doesn't negatively affect the palate). Great service, too. Let's just say there's a reason Dishoom is rated among the top Indian restaurants in London. :)"
14/9/2017,4 star rating,"The hubby and I came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. The restaurant was kind of busy even at almost  2pm. We were told that it will be about half an hour wait. We decided to do it, but we were actually seated in about 10 minutes. The waiter was very informative about all the dishes and offered us a non dairy menu since I'm slightly lactose intolerant (meaning I can have some dairy but not a ton of cream or yugert in the dish). We decided on the following dishes: KEEMA PAU - spicy minced lamb Really flavorful and not too spicy. DISHOOM CHICKEN TIKKA - grilled chicken with their family recipe no yugert. It was so good and flavorful. The chicken was slightly chared on the outside and juicy on the inside. MASALA PRAWNS - delightfully succulent and tasty. Garlic naan - perfectly soft and slightly crispy A bowl of green - fresh green veggies All the dishes were great and the 3 dipping sauces have distinct flavors and you must try all of them to see if you like sweet, spicy or minty spicy. I also had a Bombay colada (no rum), it was such a delicious drink I could have 3 more. We really like this place. The only not so great  thing about it was the hostess kept telling everyone to go wait outside. It was a very windy day, luckily we found a spot to wait near the entrance to shelter us from the wind. But this will not keep us from coming back."
14/5/2017,4 star rating,"If only the line were shorter! I came here by recommendation from a local, although she had recommended a different location. It happened that this location was close to where we were, so we just went here. Little did we know this is not only the original location, but also the smallest location! Thus the line was quite out of control. We really wanted some good Indian food before we left London, and so we stood on line. At least they were serving chai, mint tea and shiraz while you waited on line. The chai was quite good. When we finally were seated, the food did not disappoint! Everything we had was delicious, and the service was good. In fact, the food was so good, my husband even ordered an extra dish. Really, the worst thing is the wait. Next time I would try another location."
3/8/2017,5 star rating,"My husband and I had a great experience at Dishoom-Covent Garden. In fact, we dined there three times during our one-week stay in London because we enjoyed it so much. Everything that we had (Chicken tikka, lamb, samosa, calamari, etc.) was delicious. I cannot have dairy and it was wonderful that there was a dairy-free menu. For items that were prepared to be dairy free (i.e., no butter used), I appreciated that there were ""allergy"" markers on the food. I can't tell you what a relief it was to eat a meal at a restaurant without being terrified that I would have a reaction.   On each of our 3 visits, everyone we encountered, from the people at the door, to the hostess, to the bartenders, to the wait staff, was friendly and helpful. As others have warned, it does get busy. If you make it there before 5:30pm, there isn't much of a wait.  After that, expect to wait.  One night, we got there about an hour before they closed, and we still had to wait 30 minutes.  I was told that during their busiest time, you can expect to wait at least 2 hours.  It is worth the wait though."
13/9/2019,4 star rating,"Well worth the hour and a half wait.  They serve tea samples while you wait in line to get inside. Nice touch. Everything was great and our waitress was helpful in steering us in the right direction when we ordered. Highly recommend the prawns, gunpowder potatoes, and the lamb chops. Plenty of teas and sodas to choose from which was cool since we don't drink;)"
7/7/2010,4 star rating,"""London's first Bombay cafe, Dishoom brings a slice of cool Bombay to Covent Garden"" says the website and so it does. We were lucky enough to be invite to a pre-opening dry-run but you can sample their delights from Thursday - with the added bonus of 50% off during their first week.  No reservations are required so get there early to avoid disappointment!!!! I can categorically say that this place will be full to bursting from the off... Dishoom advertises itself as a street cafe, which are, having done my wiki research, apparently (and sadly if this restaurant is anything to go by) a dying breed. The menu is simple and varied enough without being overloaded with choice. The dishes that come are small, but don't be deceived, we only ordered a small dish and main each and were stuffed and barely touched dessert! There is an open kitchen, try and nab one of the popular booths in the bright and airy room upstairs, serving dishes such as chilli cheese toast and fish tikka, and main dishes including salads, roomali roti wraps and grilled kebabs. We were spoilt for choice with hot cumin laden lamb chops, a juicy mince meat keema pau spread on buttery bap, delicate flaky fish fingers which are perfect with the fragrant mint sauce, a hot! hot! byriani, and my favourite (and their signature dish) the melt in the mouth chicken tikka.. just beautiful. We were absolutely gutted when they accidentally sent us some prawns and then immediately took them about. The looked big and fat and juicy and the smell of coriander and lime.. Mmmmmmm... oh well.. next time!!! Service was a bit haphazard, as you'd expect on a dry-run with frazzled nerves in the run up to an overdue opening. But it was smiley and our waitress and greeter were lovely and chatty and amazing knowledgeable and helpful. The only supremely petty criticism I would have, and this is purely my own taste I should pint out, is that I wasn't a fan of the black tarka daal; which tasted more like Heinz mulligatawny, whereas I like my daal almost a warming slushy oniony, garlicky soup. And the chocolate fondant didn't sit so well with the rest of the menu, we all had ideas about how to make it more authentic; chilli said one, NO, cardamom said I. The waiter said that they were thinking of making it a chocolate and pistachio brownie.. mmm, that will go perfectly with the cinnamon (and nutmeg??) ice-cream served alongside, which was just divine and I'm not especially a fan of ice-cream - it's not a real dessert to me, more of a fob-off. The gola ices were also lovely, the mango and ginger a perfect palate cleanser. Unfortunately we didn't try the chai or the cocktails, we were just too full of food and drink to even contemplate it, I'm leaving that for a revisit. They won't be waiting too long... like I said there's 50% off the first week AND they open for breakfast. oh woe is my wallet!"
27/7/2019,5 star rating,Some of the best Indian food I have ever had.  The server was very attentive even thought the place was packed.  Wait times were 1.5 hours when we got in line but the quality of food was worth it.
19/11/2017,4 star rating,Ridiculously long line to get in but the food and service were great. The drink selection was a tad sparse.
12/5/2013,4 star rating,"Some of the best Indian food I've ever had! We waited over an hour to get seated, but I guess that's just bound to happen at a good restaurant in Central London. We were given some free ""naughty"" (read alcoholic) chais to start with. Then after about 30 minutes, we were sent down to the bar to hang out until our table was ready. For 7 of us, we ordered quite a bit of food and drink, and ended up paying about 19 quid per person. Some of the dishes we ordered: keema pau and vada pau - definitely preferred the keema of the two paneer and mango salad - fresh with a nice kick to it, one of my favorites house black daal - tasted great with the naan and roti chicken berry britannia (biryani) - much spicier than expected, but still good lamb boti kabab - a little dry for my taste murgh malai - very tender, my favorite grill item And loads of naan, roti, and rice. More than enough food. We probably could have taken out one of the biryanis (we ordered 2 of those), but a fantastic meal overall. They do take reservations, but it probably has to be days in advance. We tried a few hours before and they weren't accepting any more."
12/9/2011,3 star rating,"I came here for dinner after spending a somewhat rainy day seeing the sights in Westminster and spending a little time avoiding said rain at the National Gallery. Living right next to the neighborhood for curry in NYC (dubbed 'Curry Hill' as a result), I wanted to check out how curry in the UK would compare. Getting a seat was easy enough, but unless it was a bad day, do not sit downstairs unless absolutely forced to. There's no natural lighting (which is depressing at 6 PM), but whatever was going on in the bathroom was infecting the aroma of the entire room. I don't like dining in places that smell like dank urine. After struggling to breathe for a few minutes, my girlfriend and I were able to get a seat upstairs. Much better, but a mark off for having a bar downstairs that smells worst than most dives. The food itself was alright, although I wasn't blown away, particularly at London prices. The lamb kebob was very flavorful, but the portions were a bit small (a recurrent theme with the dishes here). The dhaba chicken curry was good as well - the curry sauce was definitely more tomato-based (or vegetable-based) than the curries I'm used to, but it didn't leave much variety for the palette. Service was pretty standard for Britain, so all in all, it was an experience that came in a bit under expectations. Even with ordering an appetizer (I forget right off which one we ordered), the bill came out to 40 pounds - which is pretty damn expensive given the rather small amount of food we ordered. Considering I can score top-notch curry + rice for under $20 in the U.S., I'd give the upper hand to the neighborhood shops that are right across the block."
24/7/2019,5 star rating,"Not much to say except yum. They do take reservations for lunch, but not dinner I believe. Food and service was great and they have a great system down for getting people in/out."
2/4/2018,5 star rating,"Visiting from the US and staying a couple blocks away. This place is a no brainer. Book it or arrive an hour before you want to eat. They have the wait process down to a science. Put your name in, you are greeted by name after a partial wait outside, then sent to the bar where seats are waiting for you and you are greeted by name again to have a drink and finish your wait. Service once you are seated is fast and efficient. All our choices were fantastic: veg somosas, lamb chops, chicken Tikka, black Dahl, chicken ruby, Naan and roti."
24/7/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing food with unbeatable flavor.   The line is long, but it moves quickly and is VERY worth it!"
13/11/2017,5 star rating,"As every other reviewer stated...this is THE place for Indian food in London. This Dishoom is just a short walk from Covent Garden so if you plan your day right you can eat here....arrive about 10:45 for lunch to get in line. There was a short line (midweek day) but they get you in & served @ a good clip. Also, even tho they are busy they don't make you feel rushed. As a light eater I opted for the Chicken Ruby, Garlic Naan & Salted Lassis. Perfect...although disappointing to not be with people to share a variety of all the fabulous choices. Wait staff is just attentive enough to not be annoying. You won't be disappointed!"
1/7/2018,5 star rating,"Well worth the two queues and the 70 min wait. One of the best Indian meals I've had in a while. Also excellent cocktails and exceptional service for London. Our server was the best we've ever had in London and was much more ""American style"" as far as her attentiveness."
1/7/2018,5 star rating,I love this place.The  best Indian food in London. If you are going to London I recommend you heading over. Just be aware of time because it tends a to get really crowded really fast.
12/1/2018,5 star rating,"Oh! My! God! I have NEVER experienced the level of hospitality Dishoom provides. Bold hospitality coupled with AMAZING food is a game changer. I'd fly to London just to eat here if I could. There was a 40 minute wait and the host said this was a slow night, but trust me you should wait. The food is just amazing!"
25/9/2017,3 star rating,"The breakfast was definitely an interesting take on my morning meal.  I have friends who adore Dishoom and it was decent, but not something I am dying to do again in London when there are so many other places to dine.  If you're looking for something quick, this is definitely not the place.  We had trouble keeping the attention of the server and getting more food and tea.  The chai is very nice and the bacon roll was good, but overall I wasn't over the moon about the whole experience."
5/4/2017,5 star rating,"Lunch reservations are typically easy to get , and we made one during our visit to London. I was afraid that all that hype will come crashing down with the first bite , but this was different. Food for most part is excellent , service is quick and efficient. Prawn koliwada was my personal fav. Lamb roast was soft as butter. Desserts are meh."
31/12/2016,5 star rating,"Is it the most authentic Indian food?  I don't know.  Was it tasty?  Heck yes!  My friend told me I must visit Dishoom when in London, and I'm so glad I did!  We were in London for 7 days over Christmas, and Dishoom decided to close on the 2 days that we were available to venture out to shop and eat :(  so we had to purposely go out of our way on our last day in London, and squeeze in a light lunch, right before our afternoon tea time (which was a total waste of money...anyway, that's a different story and review!).  Yes, the wait sucked, but it wasn't horrible.  The lady with the iPad was very friendly, and informed us right from the start that the wait would be an hour long.  I think the actual time was maybe 40 minutes?  At the very least, we didn't have to wait in the rain (since we all know how fickle London weather can be...).  Plus, the heater was on and there was unlimited Chai being served while we waited. And I don't even like Chai!  I hate cinnamon and I avoid Chai like the plague.  But I gave it a try since they were handing them out, and I was cold.  And boy was I glad I tried it...it hit just the right spot in the freezing weather, and I went back for 4 more glasses.  If it weren't because we had afternoon tea afterwards, I would've gotten a Chai for takeaway at the end of our meal. On to the food...it was only my husband and I, so we couldn't order too much food / carb knowing that we were having afternoon tea within a couple hours.  We had lamb samosas, roti, chicken ruby, and chicken tikka (a dry dish, but the meat was cooked perfectly and so tender).  And all were delicious!  I especially loved the sauce in the chicken ruby, it went perfectly with the roti.  For next time, I definitely want to re-order the chicken ruby, but also try the biryani and rice.  And can't forget the Chai......mmmmm."
17/3/2015,4 star rating,This is great value and excellent non-alcoholic options if you want to be healthy. Go for breakfast and try an egg naan and chai coffee. But it comes alive in the evening with a selection of sharing food and a mango lassi. I could go here once a week and not get bored.
17/12/2014,4 star rating,"Location- excellent! steps away from Leicester square and covent garden. Food- delicious, the problem becomes you want to order everything on the menu. Price- good for such nice restaurant. Chai tea- Love!!! lovee loveee!!!! The only thing I do not like about the restaurant is the wait. They do not take reservations for dinner...so most of the time you need to wait outside for more than an hour. I would definitely go back still but maybe at the odd hours to avoid long line up!"
29/7/2017,5 star rating,This is the best Indian food and drink we have ever had in the entire world. Their Spotify playlists featuring vintage Indian music is a fun way to relive the magic. Our server was spectacular at suggesting dishes.
5/7/2015,5 star rating,"Hands down best Indian I have had outside of India. With a table of four, we tried about 5 small plates, 4 entrees, two desserts, and a few drinks - everything was outstanding. Listen to your server, get the okra fries, and come hungry. Long waite outside, so make sure to send someone early to queue for a table."
21/9/2014,5 star rating,"I WANT TO EAT ALL MY MEALS HERE. This place is amazing! I came here for brunch (I don't normally like burnch on Saturday because it means I have to get out of bed) with some out of town friends because I thought they should try brunch with a difference. We had a full English with a twist - it was all spiced with Indian inspired flavours. The eggs had a massals spicing and tasted divine, the sausage was locally sourced but obviously coated and cooked with some incredibly fragrant and aromatic spice mixture and even the beans came with a chilli twist. Yes it was expensive, £11.50. But it was worth it. And instead of a mimosa, I sampled a Dishoom breakfast cocktail - orange and grapferuit juices with a splash of Ophir gin, which is oriental in flavour and again fills your palette with the most incredible rush of floral flavours. Yes please!"
24/8/2010,4 star rating,"There's something awesome about group meals where some one else is in charge - you get to try all kinds of things without having the indecision process of deciding yourself. This was my happy experience at Dishoom - we went for a big group meal and all responsibility of choice was relinquished from myself, so I simply got to eat and eat. And man, did we eat! I don't think there was a single dish that we had that I didn't enjoy. The dishes were full of flavour, rich, freshly cooked and plentiful. I particularly enjoyed the lamb kebabs - they were really nicely cooked and delicious with the sauces that came with the meals. I also tried a coconut milk based drink, which I can't quite remember the name of, and it was utterly delicious. It also happened to be the perfect accompaniment to the spicy samosas - they were the hottest thing that we had and were perfect too. Not crazy spicy but plenty of kick! Our service wasn't overly special, as there was a little confusion over drink orders and such, but I couldn't fault the food and the happy feeling my stomach was filled with as we came to the end of our food. The host was really friendly and the vibe of the restaurant was very pleasant, simple striking décor, and no intrusive music - it was perfect for chatting and giggling away. All in all a great experience and delicious food!"
2/3/2015,5 star rating,"Dishoom is downright delicious. I'm told this place is an authentic Bombay cafe which I can't yet verify. It doesn't matter. The food is excellent. The trademark black daal (£4.90) and chicken ruby (£8.20), neither of which shied away from flavor or spice, left me both full and wanting more. There was probably cocaine in both of them. I don't know that I care. These are mandatory for a first time order. The decor is neatly upscale and the staff was courteous to me as a solo diner in line with what one would expect based on the decor and the prices. There is only one significant downside to Dishoom: if it ever was a secret, the secret is out. Expect to wait. At 10:45pm on a Friday night for a solo diner I still waited 15 minutes. I walked by a few times and saw lines out the door. Be prepared. Dishoom, when are you expanding internationally? Please...?"

13/8/2010,4 star rating,"Two words my friends: Pau Bhaji My table of 6 managed to eat it's way through three portions of this, along with lamb chops, nann, their Ruby Murry (cockney for curry don't ya know), Murgu Malai, paneer salad, yes lets pause to drool, raita, black lentil daal, and a great many samosas. This cute café/brasserie serves up fabulous food. But the Pau Bhaji, with it's creamy veggie mash and buttered fluffy bread was the star of the evening. Some seriously classy curry! For it's location I was suprised at just how authentic the cuisine was; I mean, plonked in the middle of Leicester Square area you'd expect it to be another Punjab. You'd be mistaken. This is a slice of Whitechapel, snuggled into a classy surrounding, with leather booths, a really helpful hostess and brass finishing. Totally a Thumbs Up from me."
22/12/2017,5 star rating,"We ate at Dishoom while on vacation in London (from the United States) and were so impressed with the food and the restaurant . Their tapas style was perfect for us as it allowed us to try multiple dishes. The decor was fun and the drinks were delicious. Best part, the bill at the end was extremely reasonable!"
4/1/2015,5 star rating,You really can't go wrong here. Yes it's Indian food done to great satisfaction but the usual kitschy decor is no where to be found. Instead there is a comfortable and modern vibe that is very tranquil. I had the chicken tikka and it was flavorful and hot. The black daal was equally delicious. Over its a 9/10 for me
28/1/2017,5 star rating,"I went here for brunch with a friend and I had a very tasty meal! I had a regular breakfast dish which was then infused with spicy indian influences. It was surprising and quite unique. Book ahead since there's almost always a queue. Would go back again, yum!"
29/12/2014,3 star rating,"This place was recommended by some locals so we wanted to try this while in London.  We went to the Covent Garden location in a cold November evening, and had to stand outside to wait for a table.  While standing out in the cold, the staff brought out hot chai teas for all of us, which was already a wonderful touch.  The queue moved rather quickly, so we were seated in about 30 minutes.  The decor inside was quite cool, with Aalto pendant lamps and all. The food was good.  Definitely no complaints, but there was nothing I could remember that was amazing.  Yeah."
4/9/2015,4 star rating,"Service 5 stars Food 4.5 stars Having to wait to eat 3 stars If you have time to wait this place is well worth the place.

6/6/2018,5 star rating,"Delicious food, courteous service, prime location. Dishoom is everything I expected from an Indian restaurant in Covent garden. Highely recommended."
25/8/2019,5 star rating,"This place was worth the wait! We (a party of 3) got to the restaurant at 6:15pm on a Friday night so we had an estimated 1 hour and 20 minute wait. We we're seated just before 7:30pm. We ordered the lamb samosas (came with 3), garlic naan, rice, bowl of greens (recommended by the waitress and she was right!!), and two chicken dishes. All the food was fantastic and we had great service!"
14/10/2017,4 star rating,"Went here last night and yes it was that good. Despite the wait which was not that bad ( we were told a wait time of 50min. but it was 20 at least). Very good service. The fried okra, garlic nann and lamb Bryrani were very good. Definitely a good experience."
15/10/2015,5 star rating,"When Traveling to London, a name that kept popping up was Dishoom. A Persian inspired Bombay Cafe. The menu had so many yummy things to try. My dad makes Zereshk Polo (Persian Rice with Barberries & Saffron) so I was interested to see what their take would be. It definitely hit home, however was elevated by the Indian spices, it was one tasty meal!"
11/10/2015,4 star rating,"Went here last night for dinner. First off its easy to see how popular this restaurant is. The line to get it is out the door despite there being plenty of other restaurants around. My wait was an hour and a half. The waiters do come out and serve Indian tea which is great while standing out on a chilly night. Once you are called in they direct you to the downstairs bar for an additional 10 minute wait. For the food, I ordered: Vada Pai as an appetizer. It came in a nice warm toasted bun. This potato sandwich was tasty. Had the right amount of spices and flavor. Its small enough to eat on your own or cut in half and share. Lamb kabab was not good at all. The lamb was greatly lacking in flavor and was severely over cooked. It was tough and practically inedible. Chicken Ruby was delicious!  The chicken was very tender and marinated perfectly. I ate this with naan and a roomali roll. All in all the place is great, food is good and prices are very reasonable. Worth the wait if theres a line to get in. Will definitely visit on my next trip to London."
24/2/2015,5 star rating,"I love Dishoom (but not that they don't take reservations nor that they're always crazy busy). But logistical complaints aside, the food is excellent. One of my missions in my London life is to find a source for excellent lentils (why is that so hard?!), and Dishoom's black lentils are by far my favorite so far. Thick, rich, creamy, spicy. And only £4.95/order. I could happily sit down with a pot of that and some naan and gorge myself any day of the week. They also have a breakfast/brunch service, which I have yet to try. I suspect that when I persuade them to serve their lentils with poached eggs, they'll never be able to keep me away... Overall, a great place for Indian dinner in the heart of Shoreditch. You should go there, it's worth it."
5/7/2015,5 star rating,The cocktails are delicious and food always amazing. Great for large groups & for reasonable prices. You may have to wait a little bit for a table when it's busy but at Kings Cross the bar area has a great atmosphere for a few pre-dinner drinks. Staff are always super helpful in recommending dishes based on numbers & are very knowledgeable about the menu. Onya!
27/5/2019,5 star rating,Just arrived in London today. Found this gem near our hotel. Best Indian food I've ever had!
6/6/2017,5 star rating,"I'll be honest: I did NOT want to like this place. My husband is a big fan of Indian food, and once he received multiple recommendations for this place, he begged me to go with him. When we arrived, the line was LONG. I live in a small town without any lines, so having a 1.5+ hour wait was difficult for me. They did serve us complimentary chai tea & ginger milk, which was nice. Once we got to the front of the line, we were sent into the restaurant and directed to the bar downstairs to a separate waiting area. We got drinks--which were great; lots of options--and then when our table was ready, we were brought to have our dinner. The waitress was extremely helpful and gave great advice as to what we should order. We ended up choosing several of her suggestions, and it was one of the best meals I have ever had. The naan, the lamb, the chicken, the vegetables--it was all incredible. In addition to the excellent food, I also want to note that the restaurant was EXTREMELY well-organized. Going from staff member to staff member on our way to ultimately sitting down to dinner, everyone knew exactly what was going on, and they were very professional and respectful. There's a reason this restaurant is so highly reviewed: These people know how to run a business!"
1/10/2017,5 star rating,I was craving Indian food as soon as we got of the Eurostar train from Paris. Located very close to St. Martins Lane hotel. Food was very very good. Service was as well. They said a 30 minute wait but took about 5 minutes
24/1/2015,4 star rating,"The food here is very good and the prices are reasonable. I was pleased with the portion size and the quality of the meats used in the food. I was disappointed in the small size of the Mango Lasi and the naan bread. One of the things a I love about naan in the UK is that it normally comes in a huge piece. The naan served here is about the size of a normal tortilla cut in half. The seating was good and the service was also good. We go here right at 6pm and we were so lucky we only had to wait 40 minutes. When we left the queue was down the block. We had the vegetable curry paneer, the chicken tikka , and the chicken ruby. All of these dishes were superb, and the flavors were great. We also had garlic naan as well as the house slaw. Make sure to order a side of rice for the table as the curry can be spicy. We were excited to eat here and were glad we waited."
12/5/2018,4 star rating,Great atmosphere and amazing cocktails (in addition to the fantastic food). Ask the bartenders for their house made shrubs and concoctions... The black dal makes me so happy. Great for vegetarians.
7/8/2017,4 star rating,"Ahh Dishoom, you've come here based on your friend's recs and all the countless top ten lists you've read. You're wondering if it's worth the wait and to be honest, I don't think so. That's not to say it's not a tasty place with a fun ambience but I never go here unless guests are in town who request it, or if I so happen to be in the neighbourhood with time to kill. It's a fairly well oiled machine of the queue line w drinks while you wait, to the drinks bar area, to finally being sat and served. Menu changes with some frequency but I would suggest, if available the Chili Cheese Toast - exactly like it sounds, solid entree choice Chicken Tikka - a 'classic' dish for the less ambitious and whitewashed, but still yummy Lamb Raan Bun (except without the bread) - like a shredded lamb on the bone, this was by far the star. So flavorful and filling. Blach House Daal (lentils) - It's slight more refined spaghetti-o sauce with lentils. I wouldn't order it Garlic Naan - yum, always yum"
10/5/2018,5 star rating,"As the queue outside would suggest, this is a great Indian restaurant in downtown London. Though dont pass it by because of the line, we were seated in around 10 minutes. We sat in the basement which has amazing ambience. Service was great, food was delicious (we had lamb samosas, dishoom chicken tikka, house black daal, matar paneer, with rice and naan. The daal would be the one dish Id say was just alright while the rest were great), and the cocktails were fantastic."
1/2/2018,4 star rating,"The food and drinks here are A-Mazing! Wow I have never had such great cooked food. I had the Smash tequila drink, the chicken tikka, and a garlic naan. The drink was so good it's like a mojito but with tequila and it was incredible. The chicken was so good and it was so perfectly cooked it tasted like butter. And the Naan they cooked perfectly there was not too much garlic and it was cooked where it wasn't too bready but still tasted awesome. The one downside is that it is pretty expensive. London overall is expensive but for a students budget it was a lot. It was £7.50 for the drink, £7.50 for the chicken, and £2.90 for the naan- so about 30 American dollars total. But will still come again!!!"
11/11/2017,5 star rating,"The only bad thing I have to say about this place is that there is going to be a 1.5-2 hour wait depending on what time you go, but it's well worth it! While waiting, the staff severs a chai tea to everyone in line that would like one. You stand in line for about an hour until you get through the door, but wait there's more! Once you step in you get a buzzer to hold on to, and they will notify you when your table is ready. This will take another 30-45 minutes. While waiting you can grab a drink at the bar and a snack. We started with the Dishoom IPA, a Bollybellini and Far Far. The beer was decent, Bollybellini was interesting and the Far Far was crispy, colorful and lemony. We were finally seated and excited to order. We looked to Yelp reviews for some assistance and already knew what we wanted by the time we were seated. We had the Prawn Koliwada, Chicken Tikka, Black Daal and Garlic Naan. The prawns were very flavorful with a tamarind chutney. Chicken Tikka was bomb, especially with the garlic naan. Black Daal was so rich and full of flavor and also great with the garlic naan. At night it is very low lit but very cool atmosphere. The server was helpful and very attentive and the bathrooms were quite interesting. I recommend this place to all my friends that visit London, I can't wait to go back and try other menu items!"
13/5/2019,5 star rating,"I was hoping to make breakfast but arrived at almost noon. Turned out great because I got to enjoy their wonderful lunch choices. Had the lamb samosas made Gujarati style with filo dough instead of the heavier samosas you might be used to. With three dipping sauces, these were heavenly. Had the ruby chicken which was the right size for one person and so so good and the green grilled veggies -- very flavorful. The staff is all very warm and personable and genuine. This was one of the few restaurants where I immediately thought about when I would be back to try more dishes. It was that good. And bonus - their WiFi worked! Will be trying another of their locations now for breakfast. Thank you, Dishoom, for such a wonderful experience."
7/9/2017,5 star rating,"Food was amazing! Everything we ordered! I will say that it is true Indian style. The flavors are intense and rich in culture. Some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. We waited an hour to get in, but it was worth it. The Curry Chicken and Black bean soups are stellar."
6/9/2017,5 star rating,"London is known for Indian food, and this place was awesome.  We have great food here in the Bay Area, so I was not sure that this would be that special.  There are lines in front of this place all the time.  We had to wait an hour going early on a week day!  My son lives above this place so I saw the crowds all the time.  Everything we had was good.  We ordered based on others recommendations here.  If you have the time and like Indian this is a great place.  There is really a fun atmosphere there, and they serve you chai tea while in line, and give snacks to the kids!"
6/11/2015,4 star rating,"This restaurant had lots of charm and nostalgic decor mixed with contemporary feel. Service was on point with the whole team asking and providing for your dining needs. Iced water, napkins, more condiments clean toilets? Check, check, check. Eclectic old school Indian photo or product with packaging to keep you interested? Check!! Really enjoyed the ambiance. Now to the food. Ordered the Chicken Ruby and Bryani, lamb Samosas for appetizer. Portions were small but the food overall was good. Not spectacular as you would expect from the reviews, but just good, even at the spicy level. What makes this place special is everything else. Great place to hang with friends, drink and be merry. Definitely passes the would I eat here again test. Bring friends, this is a must try."
2/9/2017,5 star rating,"The best dining experience I had in London, hands down. The food was incredible, not just your typical Indian food. It was sort of like tapas style, but somewhat bigger portions. Also, the service was on point throughout the meal and that's saying something for this city."
2/9/2017,4 star rating,"Queue was a little long when arrived, told it was an hour and 20 min, but felt much shorter.   They have a great system... free sherry/vermouth/lemonade while waiting in line...   after about 15/20 min you get a place in the bar.... 20/30 min later we were seated.     Food was reasonably priced...   always want to order everything when I go for Indian food.   We had Veg Samosa, Okra Fries - as recommended by the sexy Irish bartender, entrees: chicken ruby and chicken tikka, black dal, basmati rice and garlic naan.  Chicken ruby and black dal definitely must orders!"
4/11/2015,5 star rating,"I am in love with Dishoom. We had a great selection, and each dish was as flavourful and delicious as the next. We arrived quite early so only waited for about 20 mins. So so so worth it! Would highly recommend the Chicken Berry Britannia Biryani, and the Chocolate Chai (bet the Naughty version with bourbon is nice, too!)"
27/5/2015,5 star rating,"This place was incredible. Simply incredible. And the food was halal! Coming to London, we knew we had to have good Indian food at least once during our short stay. After trying Dishoom, we ended up coming back for a second visit. It was that good! We tried a lot of different things on the menu and nothing disappointed. What stands out in my memory was the cranberry biryani and the rose lassi. Please come to America, Dishoom. Please!"
29/4/2015,4 star rating,"Very solid wonderful not too cheap (but not too expensive) Indian food bang in the centre of town. It should be crap. It is not. It's a little bit twee but the food is just wonderful - from the lassi (skip the mango and go for the salted) down to the sides, everything's just fabulous. Go for it."
15/5/2017,5 star rating,"I loveddd Dishoom! All the food and drinks are amazing. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. The chicken ruby, the garlic naan, chicken tikka, bowl of greens, mango and fennel lassi, bombay colada. All solid and super inexpensive. I ate here twice... Please come to NYC!"
27/4/2017,5 star rating,"This place runs like a well oiled machine. Even with an hour wait they have it set up so the time goes by quickly and you're not just standing and waiting. After waiting outside we were escorted downstairs to the bar area to wait in comfort for our table. We enjoyed a nice cocktail and snack, and before we knew it our table was ready. The wait staff was awesome helping us sift through the menu and making the right choices. EVERYTHING we had was delicious. The garlic naan, roti, chicken tikka, lamb...it was all perfect. We enjoyed our dinner so much that we returned two days later for a late lunch. That's saying something considering all the restaurant choices in the area."
26/7/2019,5 star rating,"My favorite Indian place in all of London. Be sure to try the Chicken Ruby - it's a subtle twist on a classic curry, but the sauce mixes incredibly with everything."
19/10/2017,5 star rating,"Worth the wait! Food is delicious. We had the dal, gunpowder potatoes and paneer tikka. So good! By the way, they do take reservations."
8/6/2019,5 star rating,One of the best meals I had in London was lunch at Dishoom. So many wonderful options on the menu that I will have to come back!
26/4/2015,4 star rating,"The food is great! The lineup to get the food sucks! Lol I guess because they're so good there's always a lineup at the door.  I guess you can try to beat the line by getting there early.  We arrived around 7 and waited until 830.  Thing is, once you go inside.. There's more waiting!!!! It's ludicrous!  I wonder if the place would be as busy if it was raining and people didn't want get wet. One great thing is that while lining up, they do provide you with hot drinks.  Some hot appetizers would've been nice too.. That way we're not starving for 1.5 hrs.  My husband had to go buy some food to tie him over lol. Once inside the food smells intoxicating and all you want to do is eat everything.  Maybe that's they're plan... Make you wait so long that their food is amazing no matter what! But I doubt it... The food was pretty amazing.  Definitely get the naan and grilled fish and gravy! Would go back again even if we have to wait! But that's why there's no 5 stars because of the wait lol!"

25/7/2019,4 star rating,"We enjoyed Dishoom for dinner so much that we needed to get another taste before we left London. As our flight is in the afternoon, we opted for breakfast. This time we went to Dishoom at Covent Garden."
15/8/2015,5 star rating,"This was my family's first food destination in London, and thankfully so.  The wait wasn't terribly long, but surprising considering we got there shortly after dinner opened (~35 minutes wait).  Luckily you get to order appetizers and drinks in their bar downstairs in the meantime.  The lamb samosas were quite good to start out with, but only a teaser to what was ahead for our meal. We eventually got situated at our table and were greeted with friendly service.  The waiter recommended the Murgh Malai, Chicken Tikka (spicy), and I believe the Chicken Ruby.  The first two dishes themselves are only grilled meat, which is what we ordered, and so he recommended to order (what most reviews here are raving about) the Black House Daal. We followed his recommendations and also ordered garlic naan on the side. The food didn't take terribly long considering how busy they were, and we tried it out. Hands down, this was the best taste out of ALL the restaurants my family went to, spanning the food in Paris, Venice, Rome, and Prague.  The blend of aromatic spices in the daal, perfectly tender and juicy grilled chicken (both the Murgh Malai and Tikka were good, but I would recommend the Tikka for flavor), and the perfect pinch of cilantro, red onion, and tomato? medley all led to a superb tasting meal.  The only gripe was the cost - the single meat portions are a bit small, so we ended up ordering 3 portions for the 2 of us, and altogether everything cost 43£!  It was a bit of a surprise, but I guess it is London after all.  You can get by with a 10-15£ order per person but we were just too hungry at the time.  Other than that one minor drawback, this should hands-down be your #1 destination for food during your stay in London."
31/3/2018,4 star rating,"Great Indian food, very nice atmosphere and prices are great! I would suggest having a reservation specially during the weekends because it tends to be big lines. Been there many times, if you don't like spicy food there aren't really meany options that are not spicy but I would give it a try! Recommended dish: Lamb Biryani and Lamb Samosas"
10/8/2017,5 star rating,"I didn't realize Indian food could taste this good in a while (I'm Indian!). We ordered Mutter Paneer, Dal and Chole Bhatura. All tasted excellent and service was good. Only negatives are 1) wait time of 50mins and 2) portion size is small (therefore had to order 3rd dish for 2 folks!). Anyway, check it out."
9/9/2014,2 star rating,"I have to confess to being bemused by the great fanfare that accompanies Dishoom. I hadn't heard of it, but love Indian food so was more than happy to give it a try for a dinner with a couple of friends. We pitched up at 7pm, were told that there was an hour wait. Happily I'd had an afternoon snack, so didn't mind waiting but it seems to me that if you're going to make people queue for an hour then you'd better make damn sure there's something worthy of that wait at the other end. We didn't get to sit down and order until about 830pm, with nothing but a small glass of chai tea (which I confess, tasted like it had been made from PG Tips) to sustain us in the interim. On the plus side, our waiter was attentive and helpful once we were seated, making recommendations about what to order, almost all of which we took. Between three of us, we had the Pau Bhaji, which set the tone for the rest of the food, being of a mushy consistency albeit quite tasty with the plain rolls with which it was served. We also ordered the Prawn Koliwada, which turned out to be the tastiest dish of the evening in my opinion. they didn't live up to the waiter's description of them as spicy, but they were very well seasoned, and delicious, with a decent number of prawns for a side dish served in a central London eaterie. The vegetable biryani was fine, comparable to what one might get in a decent local take out. the black dahl was surprisingly stingy with the lentils and had a taste that was slightly reminiscent of Heinz tomato soup (I kid you not). The biggest shocker (apart from the roti we ordered which came as a wafer thin bread that was impossible to scoop and eat with - I've eaten my fair share of roti and never seen anything like that) was Dishoom's Covent Garden Chef's Special, the Haleem, a 'revered dish that journeyed from Arabia to Hyderabad in the 19th century, and was there elevated to art form'. It was described on the menu as l lamb, cracked wheat, barley and lentils cooked for hours then pounded and served with a sesame onion seed naan and a garnish of green chillies, fresh ginger, fried onions and mint. What we got was greying mush that I have subsequently described to people (with no small degree of accuracy) as reminiscent of the nutrient goop that people have to eat in post-apocalyptic societies. It didn't really taste of much, particularly without the garnishes, and it was difficult to tell whether any animals were harmed in the making of this dish (if they were, it was an unworthy sacrifice). to top it off, the Bombay Pimms (""The classic English quencher gone native with saffron gin, mint, pomegranate, citrus and coriander. Fiery ginger beer, not lemonade"") I ordered tasted only of ginger beer, and not the fiery kind. Pleasant service and an exotic twist on the passing vogue for vintage interiors in no way make up for the crushing disappointment I experienced here. It's only the (slightly too noisy) ambience and the fact that the food wasn't bad so much as 'blah' that makes this a 2 rather than 1 star review. This is typical of the trend for taking cheap, tasty street food, prettifying it beyond all recognition (usually jettisoning taste at the same time) and then charging a bundle (the lamb goop was £16!) for the privilege. thanks, but no thanks - I'll be sticking to the bustling environs of Tooting or Southall in future."
19/7/2019,5 star rating,"Dishoom offers a wonderful take on street-style Indian food. The wait at dinner time can be very long (1-2 hours), but you can typically get a table for lunch in under a hour. If you are looking for the most authentic Indian food, this is not the place for you, but the food is still absolutely delicious. My one complaint is that they would not let us adjust the spice level of the curries we ordered."
28/9/2014,5 star rating,"I have died and gone to Indian heaven! Everything from the courteous host, to the affable staff, to the amazing food was just perfect! Our waiter Joseph was incredibly helpful in helping us navigate the menu, and provided expert advice so that we optimized our menu choices and pairings.   This might be the best Indian food I've ever had outside of India.  The chef is invintive in his use of traditional spices, and the dishes are perfectly portioned for sharing so that you can try a wide variety of offerings. This dining experience makes me regret that I am an out-of-town guest, as it is one that I wish I could repeat over, and over again."
11/11/2014,5 star rating,"Best Indian food of my life. I don't even know where to start, but whatever, here I go. Found this place online and saw that it had really, really good reviews so I was intrigued. At first I tried to make a reservation on OpenTable but it was booked solid for the next WEEK so I took matters into my own hands and power walked to the place at 5:45pm on a Sunday. Even then, there was about a 20-person line out the door -- but it moved fast. After about 15 minutes in line, we got seats at the bar and I ordered a Bombay Colada, my sister ordered a virgin one, and my mom ordered a Gin Fizz. Prices were reasonable but on the expensive side -- BUTTT they were well worth their prices which is very rare. I watched the bartender as he made our drinks, and I kid you not, it was like watching a skilled artisan making artisanal goods. I was very impressed, and this was even before I had tasted my drink. It was AMAZING. So amazing that I didn't even care that there was practically zero alcohol content; it was all about the flavors. It was like the rum was just there to sweeten the drink. (I had a sip of my sister's virgin version and while it was good, it was lacking a little something-something, i.e. cane sugar via rum.) Just as we were finishing our drinks, as if it were clockwork, our table was ready. (SIDE NOTE: I haven't talked at all about the decor, but it was pretty great too. Super cozy and warm, but also quirky and modern with lots to look at. The main dining area is on the first floor where there is an open kitchen you can peak in to watch your food being prepared, and then the bar and additional seating is downstairs in the basement -- which one would think would be a bit more second-class, but it was NOT. In fact, I was kind of hoping for a table downstairs instead of upstairs because it just seemed so cozy and everyone looked so jolly.) Anyway, back to the food. Once we were seated at our table, we were greeted by our lovely server Praveen (sp?) who was friendly and welcoming, and extremely helpful in walking us through the menu. We ended up ordering vegetable samosas, Pau Bhaji, the house Chicken Tikka, Rajma-Chawal, house Black Daal, Roomali Roti, and some good ole garlic naan. Now I am going to spare you from my pathetic descriptions of these foods I can barely pronouce, but I will tell you this, everything was DELICIOUS. Everything. There was not one thing we ordered (we shared everything) that I did not like. Everything was the perfect amount of spicy, and all the flavors were rich and tasty. I'm Pavlov dogging right now just thinking about it. Ugh. I want to go back. Also, the food came out very quickly, and more or less all at once, which was awesome because I was starving. We ate a shit ton of food, and were certainly full, but the thought of skipping out on desert after enjoying every SINGLE thing we had ordered just seemed ludicrous. We did not want to miss out. Each of us got a Chai tea, and then we split a bowl of cinnamon ice cream (sooo rich and creamy) and a pistachio Kulfi -- I had no idea what the latter was, and still don't fully..., but it was so delicious/rich/creamy/yum. Kind of like a cross between ice cream and a popsicle (it comes on a stick). Idk. In conclusion, best indian food of my life. I miss it so much. And I will CERTAINLY be back each and every time I am in the UK. Will probably make a reservation next time though. PS, prices are very reasonable/affordable, staff is extremely hospitable, and the place is just not pretentious at all. Wide range of customers and EVERYONE seemed to be a happy camper/enjoying their dining experience."
13/6/2017,5 star rating,"The food here takes your taste buds on a rollercoaster. Lamb samosas, black daal, garlic naan, and basmati rice. It was to die for. The chai is smooth with a kick of spice as you swallow. Delicious and warm."

18/3/2015,4 star rating,"A much different indian experience ... fancy interior, fancy exterior and fancy location. The food was fantastic (Chicken Ruby was so incredibly tasty) and the desert was outstanding. Waiting staff is super friendly and provides an amazing experience. Is it worth the 90 minute wait in comparison to other Indian restaurants...not sure but if you can get in without the long wait, it is most certainly worth it."
19/1/2017,5 star rating,"A long overdue review. We had their daal, which is spicy lentil stew, and chicken ruby. We also had naan, which was deliciously burnt and buttery. Take me back to London please. Britain's food is notoriously well known for being foul, but their Indian is spot-on. No, the food is NOT authentically Indian. It is very fusiony. However, that doesn't mean it's not mind-bogglingly delicious. A spot that you HAVE to try if you're ever in town."
22/9/2017,5 star rating,"Tikka Masala Heaven!! Being from NYC, we always think that we have the best of everything but Dishoom proved this to not be the case. This was the best Indian food I've ever had in my entire life. The line is long and be prepared to wait for at least an hour, but it's totally worth it. While in line, the staff will offer you some chai so that was very nice and enjoyable. I'd like to list up some dishes that we ordered that were amazing but truthfully, the entire menu is on point."
9/3/2018,5 star rating,Best Indian restaurant in London!! Yum food and nice stuff  I would recommend everyone who loves Indian food to go there....
11/7/2019,5 star rating,There are enough longer and more articulate reviews on here so I'll keep this brief. Dishoom is magnificent. An incredible dining experience and absolutely worth the endless wait you will inevitably face.
16/4/2019,5 star rating,"Dined solo this afternoon for lunch. Had no idea this place was as trendy and sought-after as I am traveling from the States. Hands down, the BEST Indian food I've ever had.  Had the house Tikka, garlic naan, and veggie samosas. The lovely waitress made sure my order lined up with my expectations prior to putting in the order. Glad she did because things were slightly different than I expected, but with her help, I received a perfect, fantastic, flavorful delight. Highly recommend!"
5/9/2014,5 star rating,"Came here around 6pm and there was a line  of about 25 guest out the door. The person taking reservations told us it would be about 45 minutes. We opted for an outside table half way through our wait. They do give out hot tea to waiting guest though, so that's a plus. We ordered the chicken ruby, black daal, shrimp, and garlic naan. The chicken ruby was my favorite, right amount of spice but not spicy at all. The daal was great but I could have used a touch more spice with it. Of course we had a delicious garlic naan bread to soap it up. I would definitely return, but come early. Oh yeah they only take reservations for groups of 6 or more."
9/5/2016,5 star rating,"Best food I've had in London. Great waitstaff that gave me a table almost immediately despite being a single traveler with a large backpack. Food is reasonably priced, authentic, and tasty. I highly recommend a Mango Lassi to go with your food as it balances out the spice very nicely without being too sweet."

1/5/2015,5 star rating,"Worth the line. Pretty cute hip place and also really really delish. We tried lots of little things and each was better than the last. We also waited in line outside in winter for like 30 mins. This felt a bit nutty, but it was worth it. I wouldn't say this about too many places! Good for dates and good for a group of 4 but not much larger groups. It's loud and a bit hard to hear."
14/9/2015,4 star rating,"I couldn't quite bring myself to give this place 5 stars for the same reason many here have explained: the wait. Granted, my wife and I arrived on a Saturday evening at about 5:30, but still. Then again, the wait itself wasn't too awful. The line serpentined in front of the entrance and a lovely host greeted each party individually explaining the wait time (a MAX of 1 hour 10 minutes--which turned out to be a bit short of the actual wait) and asking if we had any questions. They also offered free lattes for anyone waiting. The total wait time involves three stages: wait outside, wait just inside the entrance, and wait downstairs at the bar. I don't know if this was making me more apprehensive or alleviating the wait time by creating a sense of ""we're moving along now!"" The food itself was great, albeit on the smaller side for dishes that should be shared. We ordered the chicken tikka (great chicken, though does NOT come with any sauce or curry), the Black House Daal (which offered some great moisture to the chicken), naan, rice, and vegetables. No issues with the food other than the fact that the waiter seemed surprised by what we were ordering. Not sure why."
21/5/2018,4 star rating,"Good food, friendly service, pleasant experience and a nice experience. But, not worth a long wait that many Yelpers reference can take place after 6PM."
6/7/2019,4 star rating,Fun atmosphere and delicious Irani /Indian fusion dishes. Delightful wait staff made our lunch even more enjoyable.
4/5/2016,3 star rating,"I decided to visit after reading all the raving reviews and I must admit I was a bit disappointed. Besides the unavoidable queuing since they do not accept reservations, I was also not impressed by the food. By all means it was not bad, but really not up to the hype. We ordered the chicken Tikka and a lamb biryani with several sides. Lamb was good but tikka was dry. Overall service was ok but I would not come back especially if there was to wait like this time. My favourite Indian stays café Namaste in the east side"
23/2/2018,5 star rating,"One of the very best Indian restaurants ever. Waiting times can be up one hour long, but it is well worth the wait. Chicken curry was very tender and mango lassi was spectacular."
23/2/2015,3 star rating,"I'd heard a lot about Dishoom, and so really wanted to try it. After not being able to get in the night before, we made a reservation and got a table to following day. I guess the problem is that we went to India last year and so our expectations may have increased quite a bit for Indian food. We started with the samosas, and frankly they could have come from absolutely anywhere. The thing that improved them was the chutneys. The tamarind chutney in particular took me right back to my time in India. I was also pleased to see that the naan we order arrived in the exact same manner, style and taste as we had in India. But what is with all those people ordering it without butter? Seriously people - it'll be much better with!! We had both the paneer and the chicken tikka. I preferred the paneer but it was a little under seasoned for me - but the texture showed that it was super fresh. The chicken tikka... Well I could tell it had been made properly - no red food dye in sight. But it was a bit bland - I needed to spice all of it up with the chutneys. I'd come back to Dishoom, as I've read enough solid reviews to make me think that we just ordered badly. I must say that the staff for the most part are excellent."
13/11/2017,5 star rating,Traveling to London for a conference at the start of September I went to Dishoom. It was the best Indian food I have ever eaten in a restaurant. I had brought some clients ( a group of 6)  to have dinner and they were all flabbergasted with how good the food was. I have to say that everything that was on the menu was amazing. The service is phenomenal as was the manager helping us get a great table upstairs. It worth every penny you pay. MAKE SURE YOU MAKE RESERVATIONS IN ADVANCE IF YOU HAVE A GROUP otherwise you will be waiting for some time outside in the line up sipping on Chai. Thank god I made reservations 2 days previous to my dinner.
30/8/2017,5 star rating,"All around fantastic place. Love this location in Covent Garden, so it's busy, but totally worth it. The food is flavorful and authentic - you must try the pav baji, it is delicious. I order it every time I dine here. The ambiance of the restaurant is also a plus! Definitely one of my favorite Indian restaurants in London! Do yourself a favor and try this place, you will not be disappointed."
27/9/2018,3 star rating,"Extremely overrated and I am shocked at all the glowing reviews. This Indian food was fine. In a city with a lot of good Indian food I didn't think it stood out at all. The restaurant is enormous. The service was very good, can't fault em for that. In fact overall Dishoom was totally decent, but I would never tell someone this is a must-go spot. If you're gonna wait for something special in London, I'd go to Hoppers."
12/2/2018,5 star rating,Amazing food! I reallly enjoyed my experience here in London. Service was super fast! There is always a wait cause it's that good!!! It was cold outside and they greeted us with chai while we waited. It was so nice! Their lamb chops and biryani was amazing!
11/2/2018,5 star rating,"Great food and atmosphere, as well as good service. Make sure to go during off hours to avoid the crazy wait times as it is super popular for dinner!"
17/2/2015,3 star rating,"I really wanted to love Dishoom... I'd actually call it a 3.5, if I could. We tried to go at 5.30pm on a Wednesday, before a movie premiere, but were told there was a half an hour wait. We were told then too that you can make reservations up until 6pm so we decided to leave it and come back the next day, ahead of yet another movie premiere, with a reservation. So the next day we turned up at 5pm and the place was busy but not full. Since it was so early for dinner, we just had a few things. We shared some lamb samosas, and I had paneer tikka, and my husband had chicken tikka. We also shared a garlic naan. The samosas had a good taste, and went well with the lovely chutneys, but judging by the slight softness and the speed, they were not fried to order. My paneer tikka was fine, but the paneer was a bit bland and the spice paste just didn't really stick to it well so it was mainly plain paneer. I love paneer so it wasn't a total lost cause, but it took a fair bit of the chili chutney to make it tasty. The bread was the highlight, fresh and just like we had in India. We spent most of our time watching the man making the bread at the tandoor, as we were sat next to it. I didn't have any of the chicken tikka, as it was thigh meat and had skin - just not my thing. It was pretty expensive for what we had - it came to around £30, with our drinks (a Limca and a Thums Up). I think I'll try it again, but I'm not running back."
24/8/2017,4 star rating,"Very BUSY, had a 45 min wait 30 if which was in a line outside.. a bit pricy for Indian fare in London, unique small plates very different than most menus, shareable. NOT a drinking establishment - mixed drinks were unimpressive and beer is by the bottle only. Steer clear of the Gola kala Khata! Tastes like umeboshi"
1/11/2016,5 star rating,"We had the chicken ruby, the lamb kabobs and the pau bhaji.  One was better than the other.  A couple of good drinks as well.  They got us in and seated much faster than promised, which was great.  Prepare to wait, but it's worth it."
6/8/2014,2 star rating,"I feel like I'm the only person in London who doesn't really ""get"" Dishoom. The decor is cool. It has a neat, sort of vintage speakeasy kind of feel to it. The dining experience here definitely beats the kitschy, 1980's living room atmosphere I'm used to with mom-and-pop Indian joints back home. Service was totally fine as well. The food though. Ultimately, for me it doesn't matter how cool a restaurant looks if the food isn't up to snuff. I stopped in for lunch one day after reading all of the reviews. I just don't.. get it. We got the chicken tikka, the lamb with rice, and some garlic naan. It was tasty, don't get me wrong, but really not life-changing in my mind. It made me a little depressed to shell out the Central London premium when the bill came, knowing that there are better and cheaper alternatives in East London. Not a hater, but not exactly a fan either. I just found it to be wildly overrated. To each his own, I guess."
1/2/2016,3 star rating,"The food was genuinely not Indian. I do understand the need to westernise Indian cuisine as the habits may vary. However, you don't have to pretend to render it gastro when all you do is scrap all the spices from traditional daal or curry. Naan bread was delicious as well as the chai."
14/8/2017,5 star rating,I recommend this place to anyone the staff are so helpful I look forward to going again it caters for your tastes when the weekend comes
24/1/2018,5 star rating,"Went with the family, 6 of us altogether, and we all had a nice breakfast as usual (we've been there a few times before), the staff were all friendly and courteous, the food was very nice - we had a selection of food from an omelette to bacon / sausage on naan with masala beans, and 'bottomless' chai (indian masala tea) - everything tasted nice and we had a lovely time."
12/10/2014,4 star rating,"Upon first entry, I really liked the ambience. Simple but classy, western but with a tinge of Indian food scent in the air, it was the right balance of ethnic and sophisticated. The fourteen of us ordered three plates of each of chicken tikka, grilled prawns, veggie curry and a few other things. Everything was simple but solidly done. I particularly liked the chicken tikka masala and the grilled prawns. The former was just perfectly spicy to fit my taste, and the latter was flavourful despite the simplicity of seasoning. For drinks, I got chai then black coffee for desserts. Apparently, the chai here is highly recommended; I liked it but not being a chai expert, didn't really see what was so stand out about it. Finally, the staff was friendly overall and prompt in service. Make sure you book in advance if you're more than a party of six. If not, I heard you need to walk in, so leave time for some extensive queues."
21/10/2017,5 star rating,Great food.  Probably the best Indian food I have ever had.  Very small and the wait can be long but definitely worth it.
25/3/2015,4 star rating,"Finally came to eat here after rave reviews - we were the first in the queue outside (arrived at 5:25) but within 5mins there were 10ppl behind us. We ended up only waiting half an hour - got to wait in the bar inside so weren't left in the cold for too long although I know of people who've waited over an hour in the queue outside. I had the Bangha Lassi - absolutely delicious! Could be a dessert tbh. Also had some chai tea, which was nice but doesn't compare to the real stuff (if you've been to India). I'd always heard that Dishoom was ""affordable"" but I honestly thought it was quite pricey considering I got 5 little pieces of lamb kabab - however it was tasty. The calamari and prawn koliwada were probably my favourite dishes. Also the Malai Kulfi and the Pineapple and Pepper desserts were pretty amazing! Best bet is to be in the queue by 5:30pm latest so you only wait between 30-45mins"
6/8/2017,4 star rating,"This was my first time trying restaurant style Indian food, instead of takeout or fast-food , and I left the place on an good note , the wait was long, but the food was definitely worth it. They serve the food in plates meant to be shared with groups, one thing that annoyed me is that the rice and naans did not come with the plates you had to pay for them."
27/5/2014,5 star rating,"I'm salivating at my computer as I type. Utterly delicious evening. This place is run like a well oiled machine. Yes, you sometimes have to wait in line to wait in line, but the service is attentive and quick ... even when quoted a wait time of an hour and 20 minutes. The time flies by with a drink in your hand and an appetizer to munch on. Not to mention the decor gives you plenty of eye candy. Now for the food, mouth-gasms galore. The Ruby Chicken, House Black Daal, and Chicken Biryani were to die for. All absolutely perfect. If you don't know what to order, just listen to the wait staff. Although, let's be real. I already knew exactly what I wanted. Nothing better to do while waiting in line than to Yelp-stalk food. I need help."
16/10/2017,5 star rating,Best vada pav ever - coming from a Mumbaikar! Food was amazing - loved the house black dal. The staff are very friendly and helpful.
14/10/2017,5 star rating,Delicious and not too pricy! Waiting time for a table is a bit of a drag but it's definitely worth it!
12/10/2017,4 star rating,"The food was pretty good, but in all honesty, I've had better Indian. I thought the complementary chai tea while you stood in line was an expert touch, but otherwise, the food was not all that it is hyped up to be. The chicken ruby was a little too sweet. The lamb was delicious. The Dahl was good but the naan was a little too crispy. The lamb samosas were my favorite dish of the evening, but you only get 3 of them...lame. The place was super busy, so I didn't feel like we got a super friendly/helpful waiter. Overall, I would eat here again, but only if I didn't have to wait in line for an hour. I'm sure there better places in London for Indian that don't have such a wait."
11/10/2017,5 star rating,"I get to travel the world for work. I always look forward to finding the restaurants that are unique to the city I'm visiting. Dishoom was great. I currently live in Texas, but I'm from California and of Indian decent. The food and drinks tasted perfect. I loved it and will be back."
10/3/2015,5 star rating,"Everytime I travel internationally (or even domestic for that matter) I make a point of trying Indian restaurants, as it is one of my favorite foods. We were recommended Dishoom by many locals and had also heard of the amazing breakfast here as well (we'll try that next time.) We came for dinner and I am happy to say that this meal will go down in the Top 3 I have ever had in my life. To compare, a few days before we went to the MOST rated Indian restaurant on Yelp in London, Tayyabs. These places really don't even compare, Tayyabs felt like the Applebee's version of Indian compared to Dishoom. Yes, Tayyabs food was very good, but the service was terrible and the menu is fairly simple in regards to variety in dishes and we were all having flashbacks to Thursday nights at Applebee's in the style of service and menu. Dishoom creates a unique experience from the start and the food is an incredible fusion of retro bombay in the imperial times. If that makes sense, or if it doesn't, just go here and you won't be disappoainted."
6/1/2016,4 star rating,"Probably my favourite Indian restaurant, although it isn't your typical Indian where you go for a curry and a beer... It is far more sophisticated than that! Food is great tasting and great value, and the other reviews on here will be testament to what I just said too. The only areas for improvement are: - it is ridiculous how long the door staff say you have to queue sometimes, and they could clean & turn the tables a little faster. There have been times when we've been waiting at the bar only to spot at least 4-5 free tables. It's a restaurant, not a high end club so stop with the unnecessary queuing!! - could intro more new dishes to the menu for regulars. We've been going once every week/10 days for over two years now and there's only been a couple of new additions to the menu."
6/3/2017,4 star rating,"Writing this review several months after eating here because I'd forgotten the name of the place - oops! Great food, friendly service. Lovely atmosphere. Small complaint - it took a very long time for the waitstaff to give us menus, and then to take our order. I'm American and I don't know if this is standard in London, or if we just went unnoticed."
1/10/2017,5 star rating,"OMG. This place is unbelievable! We went twice for lunch and even though it was packed we were able to get seats right away (at night is probably a very different story). Both of our servers were fabulous and the food was so flavorful. I want to go back to London just for this place! Some of our favorite dishes were the okra fries, the garlic naan, and the black daal. Great cocktails as well. I loved the Bombay Pimm's. You must try this place!"
3/3/2015,5 star rating,"Excellent alternative to the amazing and expensive Amaya at a fraction of the price. What I ordered: PAU BHAJI (VERY GOOD) A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered pau bun, Chowpatty Beach style. No food is more Bombay. (V)3.90 MURGH MALAI (SIMPLY AMAZING. YOU HAVE TO ORDER IT) Chicken thigh meat is steeped overnight in garlic, ginger, coriander stems and a little cream. Still slightly pink when fully cooked. (M)7.50 SPICY LAMB CHOPS ( I DIDNT LIKE THEM. BUT YOU MIGHT) They lie overnight in a special marinade of lime juice and jaggery, warm dark spices, ginger and garlic. 11.90 BIRYANI. (WE LOVED IT) CHICKEN RUBY (VERY GOOD) A good and proper curry redolent with spice and flavour. Tender chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce, best mopped up with a Roomali Roti. 8.20 SHEEKH KABAB ( VERY GOOD. A BIT DRY THO) Minced lamb is marinated with lime, coriander and cumin, then grilled. 7.90 All in all. I would go there any time. Excellent food"
21/4/2019,5 star rating,"We enjoyed the food as well as the ambiance. The service was great. We tried Ruby chicken and matter paneer. Both were amazing. Lamb chops were, rose lassi, and black dal are winners. Highly recommend."
25/9/2017,4 star rating,"I came here on my own once since everyone was raving about the food. The food wasn't amazing but it was pretty good. However, I'm giving this place a higher rating because the service was exceptional and I was really impressed with my server. I wish I remembered her name! Overall this is a decent spot for Indian food"
28/12/2017,5 star rating,"Absolutely spendid!  My family and I waited nearly an hour in the frigid weather but the food and service were worth the compromise.  In fact, while waiting outdoors, a staff member provided complimentary hot chai and mint tea for folks on top of turning on the patio heaters which made the wait bearable for everyone.  Once inside, the atmosphere was lively both street and lower levels.  Service was superb from soup-to-nuts as the friendly staff came prepared with a food-allergy (dairy and nut free) friendly menu to keeping our glasses constantly full.  We ordered a variety of items, including Chicken Ruby, Vegetable Samosa, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Garlic Naan; all of which were simply delicious.  The food was cooked and served at the right temperature, the curry was not overly powering, and the spices were hot yet very tasty.  Although entree portions were somewhat modest, we left the restaurant feeling very satisfied.  On our way out, we were further amazed to witness two large crowds waiting in the front of the restaurant despite the darkness and cold weather (one would think Dishoom was a popular nightclub).  No doubt add Dishoom to your list of restaurants to enjoy when in London's Covent Garden."
28/9/2014,5 star rating,"Yum, yum, yum! Strolling around Covent Garden, my friend and I were figuring out a place to eat.  Someone from back home recommended this place to me, and so we decided to try it. What we had: + Okra Fries + Keema Pau + Mango and Fennel Seed Lassi + Virgin Bombay Pina Colada + Vegetable Samosas + Cheese Naan We chose to get small dishes so we could try a variety of food, and I am glad we did that.  All of the dishes were great.  Flavored with delicious seasoning, the okra fries were crispy and not greasy. Keema pau was a yummy meat dish.  Our drinks were flavorful and had a twist to them.  The vegetable samosas and cheese naan were also really good. Overall, I would definitely come back here!"
21/9/2015,4 star rating,"I tried the black dall (very good), Biryani chicken -wish if the rice was cooked a bit more- and the Kulfi Mango, i have no complaints overall. A real good restaurant with a fine atmosphere"
19/9/2017,5 star rating,"Absolutely the best meal I have ever had. We had the vegetable samosas, chicken ruby, garlic naan, and the house black daal. I first thought it was the best Indian I have ever had, but actually it was just the best meal I have ever had. The staff was all friendly. The chaihito was fantastic. Our waiter was so sweet even though he was so busy. If we are ever back in London, this is my first stop."
28/2/2018,5 star rating,"Been here twice in the last month. Once for my Birthday for dinner and once for Breakfast. I appreciate that it can be frustrating queuing, as there are limited tables to book and thats really in the daytime - however the food and the mood was great. The staff were really friendly and helpful, they were able to advise about all the food and alcohol being served and are very attentive. The food was really lovely, very fresh and diverse and I love being able to see into the Kitchen. My favourite meal was actually the Breakfast, I had the full brekkie with the Indian / Bombay infusions. Dishoom didn't disappoint and was great food & service in a calm and friendly atmosphere."
3/10/2016,4 star rating,Went to Dishoom a few months ago so don't remember the names of the dishes.  I just remember that I enjoyed the food although I felt a bit sorry for the waiting staff who seemed too busy.  If you like Indian food you'll love Dishoom.
31/5/2019,5 star rating,Definitely worth the wait!  It's a loud place but food and service were excellent.  Thank you for a great experience while visiting London.
13/3/2015,4 star rating,"Excellent food, nice atmosphere, attentive staff. Forgive the generalisation, for mere simplicity I would describe the rich creamy food as Northern Indian. I tried both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes and I was really impressed. Fresh ingredients make for tasty authentic food. Not to miss. Only warning the queue outside. Come before 6pm, or with a group (reservation possible for parties of six or more)."
10/9/2015,5 star rating,"Tried this restaurant after a lot of recommendations. It was a pleasant lunch, service was amazing and the manager kept asking of everyone is well. Food wise it was tasty and quite reasonably priced. I definitely recommend coming, beware during lunch time it does get very busy."
9/12/2014,4 star rating,"Dishoom makes me happy. Maybe it's just saying their name over and over again in my head with different emphases (emphasi?) lol. Anyways, I always have a great meal here and especially so when I'm with my famous writer-friend ;)  I have to say it gets a bit busy in this branch but the other Shoreditch one is easier to while away time in. I do love the potatoes, even though they use too many coriander seeds (it's all about being seedy ground up!) and the daal is amazing. Best value of all though is the pau bhaji - a meal for just £3.90. Bo. Or 'Dishoom' I should say!"
6/12/2014,3 star rating,"I dont know how to feel about the Indian food I am getting in London.  Dishoom is good, but nothing all that special outside of what I have gotten at some of the places in NYC.  Perhaps I am being too picky? I stopped by for lunch one day and got the chicken tikka and the black daal.  Both dishes were tasty with the chicken tikka being delightfully moist and the daal being smokey and creamy.  Definitely good food, but just not anything more than that.  I do not see any reason for this place to have lines of an hour or longer.  My Indian friend said check out Chutney Mary's in Chelsea.  I think thats my next stop."
13/12/2018,5 star rating,"My advice on getting into Dishoom - make a reservation in advance! I was in London on a business trip and luckily one of my colleagues had booked a table for all 6 of us in advance. This allowed us to bypass the long line outside of Dishoom. We were a little bit late to our reservation due to typical rush hour London traffic and they had still held the table - I really appreciated this! I ordered a mango lassi to drink and I really enjoyed the combination of flavors as it wasn't too sweet or too tart with the amount of yogurt and honey used. For vegetarian appetizers I tried the Chill Cheese Toast and the Vegetable Samosa which the table had ordered. I liked the toast and the flavors incorporated however this wasn't my favorite compared to the vegetable samosa. For the main course, I ordered the jack fruit biryani which was comprised of Delicious, savory jack fruit and delicately saffron'd rice, potted and cooked with mint, coriander and sultanas. I enjoyed the dish with the combination of the garlic naan. I will be sure to visit Dishoom again during my next visit to London!"
18/7/2012,4 star rating,"YUM. Definitely not cheap Indian food but reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. The small plates (or tapas style) are fantastic and easy to share. Food came quickly, though service was a bit slow, and the restaurant is super packed (people kept bumping into my chair). Came here around 6:30pm on a Wed night. Calamari - Very tasty but small portions. The seasoning was fantastic. Chicken Berry Biryani - Oooo that spice! Amazing biryani though nothing special when compared to other biryani's i've had. Pretty spicy, be warned. Mango and Paneer salad - The dressing was great. Very refreshing and worth getting tp balance out the heavier dishes. Daal - DELICIOUS. Can you taste the butter? Mmmm. I couldn't stop picking at this even when I was way past stuffed. Naan - Standard The waiters will try to push food on to you. We were prepared to order three things and the waiters kept telling us it was not enough. Um. Trust me. We had so much food left over, we felt guilty... and we were stuffed to the point of being uncomfortable. Start out with three dishes (maybe 2 mains and a starter for two) and build on that if you want. All the above, plus a mango lassi (Seems thinner and more watered down than most places. Not sure if I like that.) and chai (fantastic chai! though they only give you a tiny tiny cup... not a fan), was 20 quid per person. Again, not crazy expensive, but not cheap for Indian food either."
17/12/2014,4 star rating,"Great breakfast, service, and reasonable prices. I prefer the seating area upstairs to the area downstairs. Prices are reasonable as well and a lot of great veggie choices. I'd like to come back here and try the lunch as the menu looks quite good! When I came I got the Bombay omelet which was very flavourful. I was still left a bit hungry after so perhaps get a side as well. Also- be sure to try the mint tea- so simple but goes so nicely with the flavours of the breakfast items. Will definitely return!"
7/4/2019,5 star rating,"The wait was an outrageous hour+, but they came by with hot tea and a sherry sipper. The food... totally worth it! Incredible! Chicken tikka, two sauces, naan, chicken spicy rice dish too. Do it."
24/5/2019,5 star rating,"This was our first meal in London based on yelp reviews.  It was completely worth it.  The service, atmosphere, food and drinks were above expectations.  The lamb...just do it, and the chilli chicken...likewise.  And the okra...just go."
15/4/2015,4 star rating,"Been here a few time for breakfast. Great food, fast service, and the bottomless chai is killer"
14/6/2017,5 star rating,"Unquestionably the best Indian place in London. The prices are very reasonable and the food is just spectacular! If you don't reserve a table beforehand, you'll probably have to wait in line though. But no worries: they have free chai and sherry for the people waiting."
22/2/2018,5 star rating,"the best Indian food I ever had. I highly recommend  dishoom Tikka  delicious... the garlic naan bread also delicious, everything was perfect. Book a table, they get very busy."
27/11/2017,4 star rating,Pretty good food.  My chicken being pink kinda threw me off.  But supposedly its supposed to look like that.
21/8/2017,4 star rating,Delicious Indian food! First time here for brunch - ordered the omelette and naan! Both were fantastic. The naan bread is super soft and flavorful. Recommend this place for all meals of the day!
19/8/2017,5 star rating,"The food was beyond amazing! Everything was very fresh! The chai tea was the best I've ever had. And they kept refilling my glass.  The chicken was so tender, the rice was perfect, the red sauce was flavored perfectly.  I wish there was one in CT!"
19/8/2015,4 star rating,"Great food, reasonable food prices. I am just annoyed by the mandatory ""queue ; (expensive) bar ; food"" trap. It is obviously part of the business model to ""suggest you"" to have a drink while waiting for a table..."
22/8/2014,3 star rating,"Busy place on a Friday evening in a bustling neighborhood. Saw the great Yelp reviews and stopped in for arguably my fav ethnic cuisine. First impression is that it's a bit more Westernized (and full of white people) than the places I usually frequent. Open mind nonetheless! All I can say is the veggie samosas are among the best I've encountered. Flaky, potato-y, peppery, hearty, and perfectly spiced. Wow. Pairs like a champ with the tamarind chutney. And def go for the veggie version -- the lamb simply doesn't work as well. Ordered the chefs special Haleem, which arrived at the table surprisingly quickly. Creamy lentil base offered some contrast with the spice-rich additions, yet the depth simply wasn't there. And I found the plain naan a superior match to the included poppy-onion naan. Solid, yet unremarkable overall. And certainly not worth £16.50. Going with 3* here since 3.5 isn't available and I suspect this place is overrated. Based on my limited (read: singular) experience, I'd venture elsewhere for truly great Indian cuisine. But if you're in the area, pop in for an order or two of veggie simosas: you won't be disappointed."
31/5/2017,5 star rating,"Everything about Dishoom was outstanding. WORTH THE WAIT!! Every single employee we encountered was cheerful and welcoming, the drinks were delicious, the food was out of this world (the prawn moilee and the black house daal were especially incredible).... but the service was the icing on the cake. Our waiter, Gabri, was fantastic. Friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, and gave great suggestions for food. All around one of the best experiences on our recent trip to London!"
10/11/2015,4 star rating,I love it here. The mornings and odd times of day are the best as the rush for dinner is immense and often the wait can end up an expensive affair as you want to order all the delicious cocktails as your mouth waters in waiting for the amazing food. As a single diner you can get away with only having a veg dish and black dhal with bread and BOTTOMLESS CHAI (yessssss). The vegetarian options are terrific and there's plenty of shellfish/fish options for the not red meat eaters. But if you are an omnivore you are in for a treat. Honestly haven't had a bad dish and think I've tried all of them. Make sure to start with the bhel salad and go there with people who want to try different dishes as it's the best way to taste as many as possible.
16/1/2018,5 star rating,"I fell in love with this place. The staff was courteous and attentive, which made the experience more enjoyable. We had so many dishes (as we visited this place twice while in London), so I'll provide some highlights."
5/8/2014,4 star rating,"Bear out the wait! It's never as long as they say, and worth it for the free chai (dirty if you are lucky). If there is a place in Central London I like to eat in more, I haven't found it. Having loved and lived in Mumbaj it makes me nostalgic for lunch and dinner dates in Cafe Britannia and other Parsi cafés. If you or members of your group aren't used to eating Indian food, this is a great introduction with something for everyone. I've brought family, friends, and dates. Kick it off with a cocktail, all are good, but I especially recommend an off the menu item called the 'Dhoble' (Dub-lay; named after Mumbai's infamous Polic Commissioner)- just ask them to ask the bar staff. I'm a big fan of the pau bhaji/bhel/vada pau for starters. Highly recommend the Biryani or Bhoti kabobs for mains. No order will be complete without the house Black Daal (my Keralan GF adores it). Remember it's easier and cheaper to share- most dishes can serve two. Mop it all up with a roomali roti (handkerchief roti- ask to see them make it, it's epic). Truthfully dessert isn't as strong as the rest. Go for the kulfi on a stick. Chai is too small a portion in my opinion, coffee is fine but not done in traditional pulled fashion. Just grab cocktail 2 or 3 instead :) I'd be surprised if it comes to more than £30pp :)"
2/8/2017,5 star rating,Bacon and egg naan wrap was probably one of the best things I've ever eaten. Service was excellent too. Highly recommend it.
13/3/2011,4 star rating,"When my friend told me we were getting Indian food for lunch, I was expecting a lot of sauce-based curry dishes, but boy was I wrong, since that apparently is not what a ""Bombay cafe"" typically serves (as I learned later from my waiter). I thought the food overall was very good.  We ordered 2 ""Small Plates"", an item from the ""Grills"" section, and 2 orders of naan for 2 people, and it was a good/sufficient amount of food.  The ""Grills"" section, though a little pricier, isn't meant to be an entree by itself, since it is rather small.  All of the items on the menu are meant to be shared. Review of items: - Dishoom Calamari ""with zesty lime and chili"".  I thought this was really unique.  It tasted like Fruit Loops, which is a cereal from the States. - Keema Pau - ""spice minced lamb with hot buttered bread"".  This reminded me of a 'sloppy joe', which may also be something unique to America.  What I'm trying to imply is that the presentation seemed simple/cheap, but the taste was really good. - Dishoom Chicken Tikka (grill item) - this item was labeled as ""spicy"" on the menu, which I doubted would be true, given that I was in London, and people generally don't seem tolerant of spice/flavor, however it did pack a decent amount of spice to it. The service here was great, but I also came here on a weekday for lunch when it wasn't too busy.  I loved the cutesy clean diner decor with Bollywood posters everywhere. P.S.  I apologize for all of the American-centric comments written above."
13/3/2017,5 star rating,"Forgot to write this when I was in London.  Some business colleagues recommended this place for great Indian food...they were right.  OMG!  I love flavorful, spicy, but not over-spiced Indian food.  Service was spot on and my curry was perfect!  I will be back when I fly across the pond next time!  Sorry no pics this time, but I'll post on my next visit.  Cheers mates!"
29/6/2014,5 star rating,One of the best Indian restaurant I ever was! Food Is delicious and the staff really friendly. I would recommend a reservation before coming since you might have to stand in line outside waiting.
27/7/2015,5 star rating,"As good as the prior 200 reviewers said. Went with the house specials: Chicken Tikka, Black Daal, Garlic Naan, and Dishoom IPA. Perfect meal. I sat next to the service counter and watched the exec chef study every dish that went out. A couple dishes were sent back to the kitchen... There's one reason this place is so good! Quality control at the last step."
30/7/2014,4 star rating,"Getting there at 6 the wait was only about half an hour for dinner and you could make it down to the bar - I would not have wanted to be one of the people queuing when we left! I got special treatment as it was my birthday which is always nice and the food was awesome. I was facing the kitchen so can't say much about the decor but love the atmosphere - chilled out and friendly, no pretension here. Prices are also great for the area and the food is top notch. The naan bread was beautiful and I think my friend and I might now be addicted to the far far away. Will definitely be back to check out the breakfast!"
11/2/2019,5 star rating,"Exceptional execution of cultural food and environment.  I had 4 small dishes- seemed like each one was better than the last.  Spice, flavor and presentation was on point.  The only negative was the greasy dust on the light wires."
11/5/2017,5 star rating,"Phenomenal. Came from United States and heard this place was amazing. It was every bit of it. The service, the food, the atmosphere--all great. Totally worth the hour and 40 minute wait. Definitely recommend. Sit with Arlind, best waiter I've had in a while!"
7/7/2014,5 star rating,"Delicious food and great atmosphere. Book ahead or put your name down for a small wait - it's worth it! The staff were great at keeping us informed about wait times and such. They even brought out warm mint tea as the cool evening crept in. Highlights for us were the pau bhaji entree which was a bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered sweet bread, and the house black daal which was a small pot of lentil awesome. The garlic naan was also delicious, sprinkled with the right amount of fresh garlic and coriander. Yum!"
16/6/2016,5 star rating,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in London, and that's saying something. I have been to the Covent Garden and Shoreditch locations for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and can definitely say that the food is fantastic (the drinks are as well!) and the service is always good.I honestly haven't had a meal there I didn't like, and I always waddle away satisfied and hating myself for finishing a meal fit for 3 people. I will say that if you have a chance to book a table, do so. While I have been and immediately gotten a table, there have been times when, since it's London, they say it will be a two-hour wait (although, when they said that we only ended up waiting for 30-45 minutes). Sometimes there's a line out the door and down the street, but it's definitely worth the wait!"
30/11/2014,4 star rating,"Went back in 2010 for the preview with M.L. and 2011about 3 times. The prawns were the most memorable to me as well as the roti. The decor and crowds were super chic, as far as I recall, and our time was always incredible. Great atmosphere. enjoy! a solid 4.5 stars for the memories. ;)"
12/9/2016,5 star rating,"Super love this place!!! I could eat parathas and black daal everyday of my life. They have great drinks and the house chai is delicious. I always bring my friends here who want to try Indian food. My husband's favourite is the ruby chicken. They even have a full children's menu if you ask. Even my two year old loves it. But, it's super popular and gets quite busy with lines out the door. So get here early!!!"
3/5/2019,5 star rating,"We were visiting London and had heard amazing things about this place.  We had the chicken ruby, fried okra, paneer pineapple, fried chilies, keema bun, and chicken tikka romali roti.  Food was really good!  Especially the chicken tikka and fried okra.  Also recommend the masala chai!  Our host Donald was extremely helpful and went out of his way to take care of us.  Our server Deanna was also great.  Really great customer service and food.  I would definitely come back next time I am in London!"
14/7/2017,5 star rating,"The staff is SO friendly!! The food is THE BEST Indian food, but the wait can be 1 hour or more on a Friday afternoon. So worth it! The yogurt in the lassis is so fresh; truly superior."
17/10/2015,4 star rating,Overall the food was very good but the wait was horrendous and service very slow. Perhaps it's just the impatient American in me but the wait and dinner took 4 hours. Ouch. Everyone at the table preferred the lamb dishes and the naan was also quite good.
25/5/2016,5 star rating,Went to Dishoom with a friend and was totally blown away. Delicious cocktail to start and after a minor table mix up we were given complimentary drinks. Excellent customer service. The food was delicious and we both left feeling satisfied but not uncomfortable which is not an easy balance to strike. My only regret is I haven't made it back yet.
14/4/2014,5 star rating,"a MUST try~ I got this recommendation from a hall mate~ whose from India~ I really loved it. One of the waiters (who looked like a young Paul McCartney) was so nice~ BECAUSE...I was in charge of a goodbye lunch and did not make reservations for 10 people!! I was really nervous but he totally handled the situation and gave us a really lovely spot downstairs~ I would actually have my birthday here. I was quite please with the decor and how nice it was~ what i liked: 1. ambiance (decor is nice) 2. FOOD is awesome 3. must try the cheesy naan, and the chef's covent garden special, Daal, briyani and grilled prawns... TIP: i suggest family style~! the portions are SMALL. there i said it... BUT...if you have about 4 people and you order a selection of things from the menu you'll like this restaurant... if you order just 1 thing off... say the grill you might be disappointed..as some did in our group. TIP: they don't take reservations for dinner, but they do take reservations for lunch~ Just call ahead and see what's up and how they can accommodate you~"
29/12/2017,5 star rating,"Hands down the best food in London, and arguably the best meal I've ever had. My husband and I stumbled upon Dishoom by accident after three other restaurants we visited had already closed their kitchens. What a fortunate accident as we'll be dreaming about this meal for years to come. Our waitress was kind enough to explain the ins and outs of the menu to us before we ordered, and we were happy for the suggestions because each dish we ordered was the peak of culinary excellence.  The curry dish we ordered was so full of flavor and the chicken was extremely tender. The spiced lamb had great flavor although it was a little more dry than the chicken dish. The vegetable dish they offered was a great addition to our spread as it kept the overall meal from feeling too heavy. This will be the first place we visit any time we are in London in the future!"
11/11/2014,5 star rating,"When it comes to Indian food, I doubt if you will find a city outside of India that does it as well as London. Dishoom takes the cake for perhaps the best Indian food you can have in London. Move over Roti Chai, see ta later Masala Zone. I have a new favourite and it's called Dishoom (the word Dishoom is the sound of a gun shot in Hindi). This place doesn't do reservations for parties of less than 6 people. And unfortunately, it is not only popular but in a high profile location, so there are always lines outside. Weeknights, you can expect to wait an hour during peak dining hours. Weekends is likely worse. But it is worth the wait! So, what to eat? Here are my faves so far, although I haven't tried everything on the menu yet. - Masala Prawns - Rajmah Chawal (a must!) - Daal (also a must!) - Rumali Roti (again, a must!) - Chicken Biryani - Chicken Curry So take my advice. Don't fret the long line. Just go here and if you are like most, you will think it was worth the wait. I certainly did."
6/7/2014,4 star rating,"Although you can make a reservation online, you still must queue.  That's fine it's worth it. The fact people queue up for an Indian restaurant in London should tell you something:  it's good.  I've eaten here several times and it never disappoints. On this last trip we had a party of six that included 4 adults, 1 child and a newborn in a stroller.  We were seated downstairs which would have been an issue had there not been a 'lift'.   After a brief wait in the bar we were seated at a perfect table which accommodated our stroller and our party.   We had veggies samosas, calamari, lamb sheekh kabobs, Bombay toast, and then for dinner prawns, biryani and chicken tikka. Also a couple of Bombay Chilli Martinis - Quite good. Highly recommended."
9/5/2014,5 star rating,"My friends and I were visiting here and we heard that we must try Indian! We found this place on yelp and have to agree with the raving reviews! Between the three of us we ate way too much but couldn't stop! We ordered Okra Dishoom chicken tikka Grilled masala prawns House black daal Chicken berry Britannia Chicken ruby Garlic naan Guju chocolate mouse Cinnamon ice cream Memsahibs mess My favorite was the house black daal which was cooked over a day! So much flavor and so good. Okra fries are a must as well as the chicken berry Britannia.  The grilled masala prawns were good as well the chicken ruby. Let's just be honest. It was all good. As for dessert, I wasn't a fan of the memsahibs mess, but the cinnamon ice cream was pretty good. This is definitely a place I would return to. I would also recommend making a reservation well ahead as we were lucky to get in."
31/5/2016,4 star rating,"I love the food here. The main reasons it's only getting 4 instead of 5 stars are the waits and the lack of new dishes on the menu. I've had to walk away many times after showing up and being told there was up to a 2 hour wait. I would love it if they took some reservations at night for smaller groups as well as accommodating walk-ins.  Also by now I've tried pretty much everything on the menu, and it would be nice if they added some new dishes from time to time or had weekly specials I absolutely love the Chicken Ruby and I have dreams about the House Black Daal. I have never been a fan of daal in any other Indian restaurant but the black daal at Dishoom is amazing. I would be happy eating that with rice every day. The cocktails are also delicious. So 5-stars for the flavour of the food, but taking away a star for long queues and lack of new dishes on the menu"
29/6/2017,5 star rating,"Though we had to wait about 2 hours, it was totally worth it. Best Indian food I've ever had, and I'm an American from San Francisco. This place is super nice and fancy without the prices breaking the wallet, either. Though the line is long, they bring you free Sherry shots and chai tea/mint tea while you wait with your group."
28/9/2017,5 star rating,"Wonderful. The service, the food, the drinks - completely fabulous. It's 100% worth the wait if you have to queue because you are treated so well and the food is delicious. All the hype is true."
5/12/2017,5 star rating,"I have recently visited this restaurant for lunch with some business friends. It was our first visit having been recommended by a colleague, It was a fantastic experience. Great food and an excellent service. Recommend pre booking as the place is very busy"
25/9/2017,5 star rating,"Simply one of the best restaurants I've been to in the entire world. Lines can be very long at peak times, but free hot chai is served in line and you usually seem to get in a little faster than estimated. Once you're inside the atmosphere is charming and the decor is highly polished while still feeling casual. The food is superb. Be sure to try a grill and the Pav Bhaji. Be careful ordering spicy items if you can't handle spicy as they are truly hot, which is a good thing! Prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food, although the dishes are not especially large. 2 dishes per person seems to work well."
16/12/2015,1 star rating,"Ignore the 5 star ratings, this is a noisy cafeteria, it is not Indian food, and their idea of spicy is just HEAT. I am spoiled being in Seattle with all our quality Indian restaurants. I have over 20 years experience eating Indian and this restaurant failed even a quasi, blending of Parsi with Indian. The Chicken Brittanica Biryani was nothing like I have ever had. The chicken was bland, yet left your lips burning from the hot chili. None of the usual Indian flavors could be detected. The Pau Buns we just normal burger rolls toasted. There was nothing steamed, crispy, or flavorful. I don't get why there is a line for this place. Do Londoners really know Indian food. I did not approach the management to discuss the restaurant since they have a line out the door, they MUST be successful. There are just cheaply priced by London standards, so I guess that maintains a line at the door."
8/7/2016,4 star rating,"When I went there I had to wait at a 20 minute queue(though I was told it would take longer) but at least they got us tea to make out wait easier. The service is very good and the food is delicious. I definitely recommend getting lamb as it is very well cooked. The prices are a bit high and can quickly stack up if you order many dishes and you may be tempted because some of them are quite small, but it is not generally worth it, if not the best deal. Definitely worth a try."
17/6/2014,5 star rating,"I was visiting London on a business trip and got to try this fabulous place on my first night in the city. Joining my co-workers and a late night food run and walked to Dishoom from our hotel which wasn't too far. Walking up to the restaurant, we were apprehensive since it was full to the brim and the waitress told us it would be a 45 minute wait. To our surprise, we only waited 15 minutes. As soon as I walked in, my senses were awaken by the spice that penetrated the air and made me more hungry than i thought i was. We ordered a bunch of small plates to share and Indian beer to drink and refresh our pallets. Needless to say, i had no idea what the dishes were called but i can't imagine there being a bad one on the dish. Even with a wait, it his worth every second. Next time i'm in the city i will most definitely make a stop at Dishoom."
17/4/2019,4 star rating,Great waiter. No wonder there is always a que. Got there around 6 and just got a seat. Huge place but just so good it gets full quick so get there early. Staff were friendly and always happy to help. Interesting toilets gives the full experience. Would recommend pina cálida !
20/9/2015,3 star rating,"Dishoom has been kickin around in London for the past few years and has generated some hype especially for its brunch, which is quite good, if a little pricey. But hey, that's London. I visited for lunch to see if the menu was of similar quality with a friend. We arrived at 11:45, and there were immediately seated. Between the two of us we ordered pau bhaji, chicken tikka, and the black house daal. It was probably a mistake to order the chicken because of its ubiquity in curry houses around the UK, but we wanted some protein and this dish was actually quite good. The chillis dominate the flavour profile, and it was too hot for my friend, especially since there was no yogurt to cut the heat. The pau bhaji is not something I've ever had before, and the dish again didn't disappoint. The texture of the mash and combined with the crunchy bits of the pau bun were a satisfying combination. The itself was more than a vehicle for moving the star of the dish into your mouth and instead an almost sweetness to the overall taste. Finally, the house black daal. I really don't enjoy ordering daals normally because of the ease with which you can make it at home, but we decided on this because I mean, there must be something different about the flavour if Dishoom is going to call it its house daal. We were treated to a creamy batch of black lentils. It's hard to explain the taste of this dish because there were so many competing ones. This dish is not about a pure flavour and successfully mixes who knows how many herbs and spices into a complete experience in every spoonful. My only regret was not having enough naan to wipe down the bowl before it was taken away. Overall service was good and I prefer this to brunch, but only because I enjoy the tastes more. If you want more interesting and experimental food, brunch at dishoom remains the place to go."
24/1/2014,5 star rating,"I think that this is one of the very best Indian places around town and I shall grant it with my first Yelp review. The place has never disappointed me in terms of food and quality of service. The dishes are not so big in size of portion but the value is definitely high. You pay for a well-designed space with some random decorations scattered around. They are not exactly compatible but the composition do make the restaurant look interesting and comfortable. I can make a personal recommendation on the bacon rolls. The pork belly is smooth and glistering and cooked so well that it literally melts in my mouth. However, with the pork belly being on the heavy side, the dish is just the right size so I won't get too full. That leaves a wiggle room for dessert and another chance to leaf through the menu. There's this one particular dessert that can make you shiver from the goodness - the Pineapple and Black Pepper crumble. It does sound weird but one should try it before judging it. Staff are always buzzing around and will come up always at the right time when you're ready to order up."
20/5/2019,5 star rating,The long waiting time was definitely worth it. Excellent service and outstanding cuisine.
31/3/2015,4 star rating,"Setup/Concept: 5/5 Great interior space with the true feeling of an Indian cafe.With so many restaurants leaning towards a ""fancy atmosphere"", Dishoom does a great job with incorporating an above average dining room with a casual feel. Service: 5/5 We received extremely attentive service from our waitress and she was also very informative when we asked for suggestions. Food: 4/5 The food was above average in taste but could have had a bit more of a punch. I have been around Indian/Pakistani restaurants my entire life and feel that although not the most traditional food, Dishoom does a good job of gaining respect in its own way. The dishes are well thought out and executed with care. I have a habit of trying multiple things to try so we ordered: vegetable samosas, pau bhaji, lamb chops, ruby chicken, lamb biryani, naan, garlic naan, rumali roti, chai, fresh lemonade, green tea, mango lassi, khoya kulfi, mango kulfi, and the guju chocolate dessert. Overall: A must try if you are into Indian/Pakistan cuisine to give you a unique experience."
10/8/2012,4 star rating,"I'm not a fan of Indian food but a tour guide led us here and I don't regret following her! I ordered the Chicken Berry Biryani for £7.90. It was so delicious! The rice was not weighed down by sauces or fillings but rather, it was light and fluffy, mixed with the perfect amount of spices. It was on the spicy side but not flaming hot. Chicken was juicy and the right quantity. I do wish, however, that there were real berries in the dish; the ""berry"" was just cranberries/craisins. Still, the sweetness of the cranberries balanced the spicyness of the chicken and rice. My friends also ordered the Biryani and Dhaba Chicken Curry (£7.50) with naans (£1.70-1.90 each). I don't like the traditional yellow, coconuty-tasting, Indian curries but the Dhaba Chicken was a pleasant red curry and was not heavy at all! I wish it came with naan or rice already; instead, the meal kind of forces you to pay to have it on the side. Attentive service (compulsory tip) and classy place with downstairs seating for more formal gatherings or bigger groups. Definitely trendy and classy restaurant to bring coworkers, clients or friends visiting from out-of-town (:"

14/11/2017,5 star rating,"I love this place for a bacon naan and a fruit and carrot juice before work. (The one cancels out the other). Friendly staff, charming surroundings - it puts me in a good mood for the rest of the day ..."
2/12/2016,5 star rating,"The line outside is definitely a deterrent but it's also a testament to how amazing this restaurant is. The chai to customers waiting outside was such a lovely added touch. The manager frequently visited our table asking if we're okay and when we ordered more foo she communicated with our server seamlessly. The staff was very friendly and made great recommendations for food. The food itself was excellent, we ordered five dishes and enjoyed all five. Must try."
1/6/2015,5 star rating,"The food is amazing and the stuff is extremely friendly (very helpful, offering teas and chai latte while waiting as well as taking 2 of our small plates off the bill for waiting slightly longer!). I would strongly recommend it!"

8/1/2017,5 star rating,This is my favorite Indian restaurant in London. There's a long line but if your party of two it's not that bad. It's very clean inside and the service is great. The food is amazing especially their lamb dish. I visit London about 6 times a year and visit here every time. Also Punjab restaurant nearby is excellent.
27/8/2017,5 star rating,"Have been here several times, and the food is always amazing.  Service varies but the place can often get hectic!  Have loved every dish we've tried.  Also highly recommend their brunch--it has converted my opinion on chicken liver forever :)"
26/8/2017,2 star rating,"It's ok. Not ""blown away"" by anything going on here. It's indian food in a hip environment. Bartenders seem good. Food is ok. Stay away from the weird desserts."
28/5/2016,5 star rating,"I've tried Indian food in London before, but this was amazing. We started off with the vegetable samosas - the pasty was light and fluffy and the filling was so well seasoned. The samosa melted in your mouth. Also ordered the spicy lamb chops, chicken tikka, and on the side - raita, cheddar naan, basmati rice. Everything was cooked so well - meats were tender and juicy but not over or undercooked. Everything flavor packed and complimented each other so well. The waiter was extremely helpful in recommending dishes that should be paired together! Need to come here every time I'm back in London!!!"
12/6/2016,3 star rating,"Ah Dishoom... Where do I begin?! I suppose I'd better jump on the band wagon and shout about the breakfast! This really is one of my favourite places to go for breakkie in London! Served until 11am, the selection of classic breakfast favourites with a twist really hit the spot and come at a very reasonable price! My favourite is the sausage naan with a bottomless chai, coming to less than £10, but there is also the deliciously sticky porridge and a selection of eggs spiced to perfection! For lunch or dinner I'm less keen on Dishoom. The distinctive flavours of the breakfast are not repeated across the main meals menu, and for the price id rather save some money and sacrifice the dining 'experience' and head to my local curry house for generous portions that really hit the spot! At the mention of experience, that's really what you're choosing when you decide to go to Dishoom. Decked out with spine tingly accuracy like a British Raj club house, you'll be greeted by wafts of incense and carafes of water in tin cups. Where I find Dishoom disappointing, though, is that this experience is not always continues by the staff. Service is often slow (and strangely more so the quieter it is!) and mostly served by a hipster with a 'too cool for this' attitude, which somewhat dulls the excitement of going to one of London's current favourite food venues! My advice for those of you thinking of going to Dishoom? Go for breakfast, but only if you don't have to rush to be somewhere before lunch- and you'll love it!"
14/3/2016,5 star rating,"Amazing food and service, totally worth the wait! Drinks also quite good. Lovely atmosphere as well. Ate the chicken tikka, black daal, garlic naan, ruby chicken, chole (chick peas). All amazing. Dessert was also quite good. Highly recommend."
18/5/2017,4 star rating,Amazing! Best samosas I've ever had! The chicken ruby dish was outstanding and so was the naan. Our waitress was outstanding. We did have to wait for about an hour and a half outside in the rain for a table but it was definitely worth it and they were handing out warm chai!
20/8/2017,5 star rating,"Amazing food, very nice ambiance. Absolutely recommend! We had a bunch of dishes to share, which was the recommendation of our waiter. All the dishes we tried were tasty and of great quality. Will definitely go back again."
15/11/2014,4 star rating,"Expect long hour waits during dinner time (pretty much every day of the week). But once you're past the lines, the fun begins. We had the Black Daal, Chicken Tikka, Masala Prawns, and Chicken Ruby. Highly highly recommend the Chicken Ruby - it was so good. Classy decor and ambience with attentive service. Very good experience overall. Will be back (with a reservation)!"
22/8/2010,2 star rating,"There's something very egalitarian about chain restaurants. They simply don't care who you are and aren't at all bothered about trying to impress you specifically. No bookings, you turn up, wait your turn, and get the same service as everyone else. In his excellent review in the Guardian, Jay Rayner recounts how he had to stand outside in the queue with the rest of the rabble too, slightly discombobulating I've no doubt, for a man used to a certain level of recognition. After a late afternoon meeting over wine (the best sort of meeting) me and my two guests thought about staying in the rarified atmosphere of the Ivy Club but in the interests of investigative research joined Mr Rayner and other food luminaries by queuing at Dishoom. Dishoom has been referred to (mainly by the PR team) as a Bombay style cafe. An egalitarian, open all hours canteen serving taxi drivers, students, writers and lawyers (according to their puff anyway)...None of those stereotypes were notably present on the night, predominantly, our fellow diners were more the middle class braying London types you traditionally find clogging up the greener parts of zone 2. There's got to be a book written for this. 'Food Branding 2.0 - lessons for the post Pizza Express generation'. Like the equally insipid Jamie's Italian next door, and 'gourmet, authentic Mexican fine dining experience' (more PR bullshit) Cantina Laredo next door to that, the team behind Dishoom seem to have swallowed the whole volume, hook, (press) line and sinker. It's somewhat sinister having all three of them next to each other. It's the kind of line-up better suited to touting for passing trade outside a Croydon multiplex rather than prime real estate in the centre of London. The food is casual, safe and generic Indian (at risk of insulting a large country). It doesn't seem to come from anywhere specific, and certainly didn't bear any relation to what (admittedly little) I know of the hot, spicy street food of the region. For a coastal city, you'd expect fish to feature heavily, the best they could do was a 'Dill Salmon (that well known Indian fish) Tikka'. Our starters included Bombay Sausages, a student dinner party staple of the future fusing chipolatas, onion and curry paste, Chilli Cheese (on) Toast, pleasant but utterly underwhelming, and a dish called Keema Pau, minced lamb in a ragu style sauce served alongside a muffin.  These came with fridge fresh pickle pots and a highlight, perfectly chilled Meantime Union beer. Our main courses were similarly pedestrian. The Chicken Biryani was nicely presented in a clay pot with a pastry seal but arrived dry, beautifully but subtly fragranced and lacking in a core ingredient. ""Do they serve the chicken on the side?"" questioned the Drama Queen, apparently not, it was just hiding (very well) in the rice. The taste was as subtle and shy as a thirteen year old at a school disco, it felt like nothing more than an accompaniment. The Spicy Lamb Chops came with some semblance of taste and some of the vim and zing you'd expect from a decent kitchen. Beautifully cooked, tender and juicy, they were the one high point for me. The final plate, a Lamb Boti Kebab was dry again and chewier than expected.   There's a niche in the market for a chain Indian, and Dishoom gives a good argument for filling it. For anyone who's ventured within a mile of Tayyabs or Lahore in the East End, or been to some of the great curry houses of Birmingham, Southall or Bradford you're going to be left wanting. That being said, if you're stuck in theatreland with kids or random relatives who ""don't usually like that spicy foreign stuff"", you could do worse. And if that isn't damning with faint praise, I don't know what is."
15/9/2010,4 star rating,"I was lucky enough to win a brekkie for two from Qype to this new venue in the St Martin's Courtyard development ... Next door to Jamie's Italian. I arrived at 0800 as it opened to find it sparsely populated with a few suits getting ready for meetings. Had a chat to the owner - a lot of the photos are of his family, and his mum is on the front cover of the menu ... In her 70s heyday I hasten to add. Ordered a selection from the menu cooked brekkie, porridge, granola, roti; then sat back and sipped a hot cup of chai. ... more to come"
1/4/2019,5 star rating,"Dishoom is amazing, I love the food there and the design of the spaces is always incredible. Expect old Indian features and delicious food. Would really recommend going for breakfast and trying the bacon naan."
29/12/2014,4 star rating,For fast Indian food street concept that's the ideal place Love their beryani and Dal Keema with bun and bhel are amazing
26/7/2016,4 star rating,"I discovered Dishoom while searching the internet for exceptional Indian food in London during a recent trip. The details -- from the rotary ceiling fans to the steel cups to the pervasive aroma -- all intend to transport you to the Persian-style cafes of Bombay, India. As a side note, the menu is really well-done; you can almost sense the passion in flowery descriptions of the exotic offerings. Unfortunately, I wasn't particularly hungry unfortunately so we only ordered a few dishes. The Awadhi Lamb Biryani, a fragrant rice preparation, was decent but didn't blow me away. The meat was fairly soft and had strong taste, but the dish was slightly dry overall so I would order yogurt-based Raita on the side. The Mattar Paneer was fantastic, with spongy morsels of cheese soaked in a tangy tomato-and-pea sauce. The signature Black House Daal was the best course we tried by far and boasted a strong sourness that was counter-intuitive but added to the rich flavor. Get an order of Roomali Roti, a soft and stretchy flatbread, to soak up all the broth and spices."
23/6/2016,5 star rating,"This place was incredible, easily located near the theaters for a great dinner experience before or after the theater. All of our food was SO good and we ordered more of the naan just because it was too good to not have an extra order of. The environment is also really fun- loud- but it has a gorgeous interior and I really liked the raised booth that we sat in."
10/1/2014,5 star rating,"Loved this restaurant! Came in around midday on a Friday with a friend, fearing we'd hit the midday lunch rush, but luckily for us the place was practically empty, and we were seated right away! Apart from that, the locale is lovely, and when presented with the menu, both of us had the hardest time choosing what we would be eating as there were so many dishes that looked equally (read: very) appealing (always a good sign)! In the end, we settled on their house black daal and the paneer roll, both of which were delicious! Had we had more time on our hands, I would have loved to try some of their desserts - the group seated next to us tried them, and they all looked very good (not to mention how good their cocktails looked- also absolutely must try them next time!). Given the number of Indian restaurants in London, and the admittedly varying quality of said restaurants, finding a centrally-located, well-priced, and excellent Indian like Dishoom is something of a miracle! I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"
7/5/2017,5 star rating,"The wait was about 20 minutes, but it was worth it. Excellent flavors without the extreme spices. Tried the Ruby Chicken with cheese naan. Added the black daal and spicy lamb chops and we were all in food heaven."
3/5/2017,4 star rating,"Good food, great ambience and friendly service. Dishoom is a really good choice for those who enjoy spicy food. I thought it was good but definetely not the best Indian food I had in my life."
29/7/2014,5 star rating,"In the climactic scene from a violent 80s bollywood flick, the hero is hanging off the edge of a cliff on one hand and as the villain bends down to say adios amigo, the hero suckerpunches him...DISHOOM!! There you have it folks, it's onomatopoeia for an explosive fist punch in bollywood lingo and true to it's name, the restaurant has a very eclectic decor comprising of movie posters, film magazine covers, LPs and other memorabilia from yesteryears. We had a long layover at Heathrow and our friends from town got lunch reservations here. We'd heard a lot about how good the Indian food in London is and we were eager to try it for real. For tipples (acting British now lol), we got a pitcher of the Bombay Pimm's which was quite refreshing. For appetizers, we got a Keema Pau (spiced minced lamb and peas served with a toasted buttered pau bun). The keema was out of this world and tasted very similar to what it would back home. What joy in every bite! For the main course we went with the Chicken Ruby (recommended a lot on the other reviews) and the Haleem because it sounded delicious going by the description. The chicken ruby is a very tangy take on a traditional chicken makhani and the roomali roti is the perfect vehicle for scooping up the gravy. Slurp. We were so engrossed in eating that we forgot about the Haleem (a slow-cooked dish with lamb, wheat, barley, lentils and spices) which arrived a few minutes later. The Haleem which came with a side order of naan and extra condiments like fried onions,  chillies and lemon had a very good consistency and a rustic flavor that makes us drool every time we think about it. For dessert, our friends recommended the Memsahib's Mess (fresh cream with crushed meringue, strawberries, rose syrup and a rose petal preserve known as gulkand) which we demolished despite being full to the brim. Easily one of the most memorable Indian meals that we've had outside of India. Too bad it's not a stone's throw away :("
29/12/2018,5 star rating,"Get the dessert! Great Indian. Reasonable prices. Line was long but well run, friendly and with complimentary teas."
26/4/2017,5 star rating,"This place is sooo good that I waited in line for over an hour and half twice. The wait is worth it. We try so many things from the menu that I can't remember their names, but all were very good. Do not let the long line turn you away, you will love this place."
15/5/2016,4 star rating,"The food was great, the service was a little slow but the staff were really nice so it all balanced out."
20/3/2019,5 star rating,Excellent. Great service and great food. The lamb samosas were wonderful! Definitely my favorite dining experience in London
1/9/2014,4 star rating,"Wow! What a great restaurant. I've eaten here twice now - a few months apart - and really like it. Standouts for me were the black dal, biryani and paneer curry. However having tried much of the menu as well now, there is nothing I would not eat here. Lamb dishes, snacks, and even cheese toast have all been good. Overall great service- but the optional service fees annoy me still. Something I'll never get used to in London."
23/7/2017,4 star rating,First day in London. Great staff. Good choices and good quality. It is busy so make reservations. Kids liked matter paneer.
8/12/2015,5 star rating,"Best Indian Food I have ever had. I said that 2 times in my life so far, and it is very likely that this is the last time I will say it. Not only is food from out of this world, the service is incredible. I had this establishment on my list of places to visit, but could never circumvent the never ending line in front of the door, sometimes with people waiting in the rain around the corner, just for a chance to dine at Dishroom. This time, I stumbled upon it while walking through Covent Garden and - there was no line. No line means no-brainer. I had to get in. Still a 30 min wait, which was made quite pleasurable with their underground bar. 15 mins in and my table was ready. Oh boy...what a feast, and what a party in my mind and soul. Lamb samosas and to start are a great way to ease you into what's coming. Their roasted veggie spread on a pretzel bun - are simply incredible. That might be the very best appetizer I have ever had. Amazing. Of course, I didn't stop there, Lamb kabob, black daal, basmati rice, garlic naan, and dish room chicken tikka blew me away. The perfect blend of tastes unlike any other i've experienced. Staff - best service I've seen in London. Tickles my friendly, sunny American expectations that everyone should smile all the time and make you feel welcome and valued. Hats down to Dishroom."
23/7/2017,5 star rating,"Absolutely incredible. Tastebuds popping flavors in a dimly lit, eclectic venue. The most tender chicken I've ever tasted. I will be trying their signature dish a another location soon!"
8/6/2014,5 star rating,"This place is awesome; I went last night with two friends and we had a great time. The chargrilled prawns, the ruby chicken, the broken potatoes and the  black daal were stand - out for me. They also provided me with a version of their menu that had all the gluten-free options highlighted, which was much appreciated. The staff made some great recommendations as to what we should order, and the restaurant itself is really nice. It's a little annoying that they don't take table bookings after 6pm, but hey, they know what they're doing."
22/8/2016,4 star rating,Food was awesome! Lots of spices and flavors! Service was the best I had my entire trip in London. We had a guy named Gabri he was a tour guide for the menu. Loved everything about the meal.
16/3/2019,5 star rating,"Amazing Naan, highly recommend the bacon naan for breakfast. The food was delicious and the service was fast. Definitely would come back."
26/1/2017,3 star rating,"They do not take reservations after 6PM and it is a long wait. 1 hr they say, it really is one hour. Delicious food but small portions and expensive. Good atmosphere if you are upstairs. Downstairs is dark and low ceiling. After all the wait, you hope for a good table but they sit you where ever available. The coctails are notting special. Naan and lamb was great but chicken was avarage. Buryani was good basmati rice avarage. So, better to try for lunch but not for dinner."
2/8/2014,5 star rating,"Dishoom was our ""big dinner out"" place when I studied abroad in London, and I still fantasize about their black daal, which is the best I've ever had--and I've been to India! Their chicken tikka is tender and juicy, and the roomali roti (literally ""handkerchief bread"" for its thinness) is awesome for mopping up their curries. It's also a good place to get food that's more representative of Maharashtrian/Gujarati-style Indian cuisine, which is sorely lacking stateside. My dining companion, on one occasion, found the pau bhaji to be sort of overcooked, but I enjoyed it. We need more West Indian restaurants in the US! They don't take dinner reservations (something that seems to be common amongst trendier restaurants in London--I guess to up the hype?) so it can be a wait, but they have a nice bar downstairs and they seat really quickly. I also like the 1960s Bombay kitsch of the decorations--plus they serve Limca in the bottle! What else could you ask for?"
18/9/2017,5 star rating,"Obviously my favorite meal in London. The ambiance, the food, the drinks--amazing. You can make reservations if you go before 545pm, and I highly suggest it. We showed up around 445 and waited in line outside in the cold for over an hour. Then we're brought in where we had to wait a little bit longer (at the bar--how convenient for them) for them to prepare our table. I still give 5 stars though, I just don't understand why they have the waiting list the way it is."
7/4/2017,5 star rating,Awesome food. Had to wait for 1 hour to get a table but the wait was worth each and every minute. Dal is one of the best I had in long time.
20/6/2014,5 star rating,This place had to be the best Indian food I've ever had. I had not been to India before so we are discussing Indian food in London. I still had a wonderful time and really enjoyed the food. We got there around 5 and only had to wait about 15 minutes even though they said more than 35 minutes. The mixed drinks are delicious and the naan is to die for. We tried all three choices. Sooooo good. This is a MUST go!!
21/7/2014,5 star rating,"Dishoom is fantastic. The menu makes my mouth water, and I always end up with too much food. They have one of the few paneers I really enjoy, and an eclectic, eccentric, delicious menu. Everything tastes fresh and zesty, and all the waiters are well-versed in their ingredients. They have a gluten-free menu and plenty of vegetarian options, although next time I go I'll take some more meaty friends and get the haleem, which always looks so good. Even if there's a wait, it's well worth it; I've been here pre-theatre and it's always worthwhile. Very trendy decor and hip waitstaff."
19/1/2017,5 star rating,Very good food with a great service. I heard a lot about this place before arriving to London and was excited to try it. There was a very long line but we got lucky and were seated fast. Our server was amazing. All the food he recommended was excellent. I wish I lived there to go there more often but I will definitely make a stop every time I go to London
11/3/2019,3 star rating,"I don't simply love this Indian edifice, I really, extremely love this place. i'm not a believer in standing in line permanently food, particularly in London, once there's such a big amount of sensible ones around each corner...but I even have stood in line varied times for this spot. Why? as a result of if you fill in line, sometimes they'll bring you the foremost superb chai to create it value your whereas. currently in the other Indian edifice, you're getting to see your usual samosas, pakoras, naan, Tikka masala, etc...sure you may see those here, too, however this edifice you may provide you with things not offered elsewhere. The chili cheese toast for one is delicious...simple, with cheese and chives...I don't apprehend why it's completely mind-blowing, but it is. Then, you get to the nitty gritty with the okra that's thus tender and perpetually feels recent. The roomali roti lives up to it's name by being hankey skinny that you just will inhale 5 before you notice."
18/1/2015,5 star rating,Amazing!  Great service and food allergy friendly options (they had a special dairy free menu for my friend). Best indian food in London.  They don't take reservations after 6 so I would suggest taking the last reservation (5:45) to avoid the long lines later in the evening. The Chicken ruby was unreal.
15/4/2016,5 star rating,"So delicious - really really tender tikka masala. A bit spicy but the yogurt sauce really cuts it. Also, random - but the mint sauce they serve with every meal is UNBELIEVABLE. Lots of hype, trendy, but good food to back it up."
5/9/2017,5 star rating,I wish I could give this place 10 stars! The food was incredible. Service was immaculate and the atmosphere is perfect. We waited outside for an hour to be seated and it was worth every moment! Don't let the line turn you away! A must go if you are in London.
24/6/2017,5 star rating,"Actually don't think I've ever had better Indian food. Enjoyed everything that we ordered, which was a lot. Chicken Tikka was incredible and was served hot in a crock. Love the naan, but will definitely get the cheese naan also next time. You must go to this restaurant!!!!"
4/3/2019,5 star rating,"Absolutely incredible food, best Indian I've ever had in my life. If you're thinking about it just go, truly superb."
2/11/2016,3 star rating,"Value to money is good; value to time is not. One hour wait really raised our expectations, but the food turns out to be not worth the time we spent in the line. If you have time and can wait, sure. Otherwise, don't waste your life"
18/6/2017,5 star rating,"Excellent! My favorite restaurant in London! Imaginative cocktails, flavorful dishes, great atmosphere. The only downside is no ability to reserve, so you have to wait for the table (usually there's space at the bar). Calamari, ruby chicken and house daal are among my favorites."
24/8/2017,5 star rating,It was great! We ended up turning up very early and were very pleased that a table was found for us. The service and food was excellent! We'd definitely come again!
15/3/2015,5 star rating,Awesome service and flavorful food.. Had a wait that was supposed to be 45 min to eat and 30 minutes to get inside to the bar. They came out with hot mint and chai tea to keep everyone warm. We made it to the bar in 20 minutes then was immediately seated for dinner. The menu is set up to order small plates (2-3 per person) . The waiter gave great suggestions. Must go to for Indian restaurant in London !
28/2/2019,5 star rating,This place always gets 5 stars and I love it and yelp is making me write more so let me just say eat here
1/2/2016,4 star rating,"So good, I love this restaurant. It's not cheap but it's worth it. Whenever friends come to visit and I wanna take them somewhere special and consistently good this is always the number 1 choice."
9/6/2017,5 star rating,"Go for breakfast!!! They have an awesome menu, it's way less crowded, and it's incredibly reasonably priced. Obviously this place lives up to the hype and their dinner menu is fantastic, but I really recommend it for breakfast/brunch too!"
5/6/2015,5 star rating,"Great place to go with a group of friends and share lots of dishes on the extensive menu. The cocktails are also worth working your way through! I have been for lunch and dinner both times were delicious, next time I want to try out the brunch as I have great things. Tip- If possible try and sit in their outside area. It's a great little sun trap with quirky decor."
16/2/2014,4 star rating,"Proudly writing my first review for London. I had no idea Yelp would be so useful in finding the perfect dinner place in London. Visited this place on a Saturday night after seeing the Yelp reviews. Place was crowded and we waited about 20 mins. But absolutely no complaints, had a great time. This place has kitchen open till 11 pm which is fantastic. I would definitely recommend this place if you are visiting London. Of course, greater London has several hundred Indian places that are probably even better than Indian food in India,  I am sure you can find individual dishes better than this place in small restaurants scattered around London, but this place offers a sweet combination of Bollywood, upscale atmosphere and tasty Indian food. So I would definitely recommend going here at least once while you are in London. We tried the Pav bhaji, Roomali roti (Yes, they have roomali roti! -  which is certainly a rare sight in the US, Black daal, cheese toast and Kulfi. The black daal, as other reviews say, was really very nice. I really liked the Pav bhaji too, it was pretty close to what I have had on Bombay streets (buttery, tart and spicy). The roomali was very nice, and it was also fun to see the roti maker flipping the rotis through the glass window in the kitchen. I would rate the Kulfi the least, although it was well placed in an Indian style glass on a stick, it seemed the frozen lot and not fresh. I would probably go for the gujju style chocolate mouse instead. The cream cheese toast was average. They also have some chaat (Bhel puri etc.) on the menu. They have a full bar downstairs, but no draught beers. Doesn't matter much as being carb heavy doesn't go with the already carb heavy Indian cuisine. Everyone seemed to be enjoying the music and food, even the lamb and chicken dishes. People were sprawling, and not just Indians - it was good mix of people, mostly young. Very refreshing to see an Indian restaurant proudly portraying Indian art, bollywood memorabilia and celebrating Indian culture. I especially loved the ambiance. Well decorated, flattering lighting and some amazing Bollywood memorabilia from 70s and 80s. Great for a date night as well."
31/1/2016,4 star rating,"A really nice place for feel and ambience, eg the look and feel of an Indian train station from 120 years ago. The wait for a table was long, 40 mins at the bar and finally we got a table. The service was efficient and the food was ok, not really Indian, more 'irani cafe in Bombay indian', or what people think indian is?. I did enjoy the entire dining experience but that is what its all about, the experience , not just the food or drink"
2/6/2017,3 star rating,"The queue can be a bit long and then they make you wait at the bar for quite a while. Overall the food is good, not excellent. The service is always excellent and food arrived quickly. I would highly recommend the house daal."
1/6/2017,5 star rating,"This place is EXCELLENT! Long wait, but totally worth it! The customer service is unmatched from the moment you put your name on the list. They're very realistic about wait times and offer cold/ hot beverages while you're waiting. Once in, the customer service continues. Knowledgeable and friendly staff offer recommendations and the vibe is really cool; good music, ambiance, and decor. The food is out of this world and very reasonably priced. Would and will go back again! Already recommended it to two friends! Ask for Gabri - great server!"
31/5/2017,5 star rating,"My dinner at Dishoom was easily one of the best dining experiences of my life. Every aspect of the experience - atmosphere, service, food and drink - was excellent. We went around 7pm a Sunday night on a recent trip to the Covent Garden location, and waited a little over an hour for a table. Do not be deterred by the line outside! The hostesses offer you chai tea and a delicious lime drink while waiting in line, and allow you to wait in the bar area and grab cocktails/appetizers before your table is ready. The restaurant also just smells delicious - the whiff of spices you get as you enter the restaurant is a clear indication that your meal will be transcendent. We ordered the calamari and vegetable samosas as bar appetizers while we waited for our table. Both were delicious, very nicely flavored! For dinner, we ordered the prawn moilee, spicy lamb chops, bowl of greens, paneer tikka, and each of the naan varieties. We also threw in a black house daal, on recommendation from our fantastic waiter Gabri. My personal standouts were the prawn moilee and lamb chops - both perfectly cooked and just oozed with flavorful goodness. The general atmosphere was what impressed me most about Dishoom. The food and drink are extremely reasonably priced, especially considering how high quality they are. The hostesses and wait staff have service down to an art - a busy dining environment could very easily be hectic, but they go above and beyond. Thank you to Gabri and the whole Dishoom team for a supremely special and memorable meal!"
4/1/2016,5 star rating,"Best Indian food... YUM.  The U.K. is famous for having good Indian food, and this place delivers.  Yay!  Ambiance is fun and hip, the crowd watching is interesting, and the delicious food makes all of it just perfect.  We got so many dishes to sample but I wanted more.  I want to fly back to London to try more things here... Go and Enjoy!"
17/4/2018,3 star rating,"Just OK.  Nothing to rave about.  Not sure why people waiting in line for two hours for.  Flavor and spice level are tone down to 30% of regular Indian food.  Cheese chicken ruby is too oily on the sweet side, not sure why?  Daal is pretty good.  Naan is above average.  Samosa is good, Keema Pau not bad.  Spicy potato is good, spicy lamp chop too dry.  Biryani is good.  DONOT order lasi drinks, no flavor at all.  This place is more like Britainized Indian food."
28/5/2017,5 star rating,"Got the recommendation from a coworker to visit when we are in London. Amazing! Sit back and enjoy bottomless chai and wonderfully prepared Indian dishes. Our server Magdalena was awesome, attentive and made sure the our cup of chai was always full Even when we had extra dhal on the table she offered to get us some side dishes. We politely declined as we were stuffed and ready to retire for the day at 1pm with a nap Def will be back You should go at least for the chai!"
1/3/2016,2 star rating,"This place's high rating makes me think only tourists with terrified palates use Yelp in London. Dishoom looks trendy, but the food is flavorless. The waiter recommended the prawn Koliwada starter. It was heavy and flavorless. Lamb Awadhi biryani had literally no flavor. The kachumber was an insult to the name; instead of finely chopped cukes, tomatos, and onions with some spice and lemon, it was literally a bowl of giant pieces of unseasoned raw red onion with a few bits of tomato and cucumber thrown in. Inedible and gross. The signature prawn moilee curry was just OK, but given that it tasted a bit like something, it was the standout of the meal. All this, and the prices are quite high. Twenty pounds a head for lunch will buy you lovely Indian food at about a thousand places in London."
25/5/2015,5 star rating,"Where else outside India can you find Wada Pau and Pau Bhaaji? Which place outside India can work so well as a teleporter and a time machine to take you instantaneously to the 1960s' Mumbai and Pune? Excellent food (including vegetarian options), wonderful ambience, admirable service. I recommend the vegetable biryani."
24/5/2017,5 star rating,"We stayed in London for 3 days and we came 3 times. Amazing service, flavorful food and a really enjoyable experience. A must-do in this city!"
21/3/2014,5 star rating,"This is by no means an exaggeration when I say that my meal at Dishoom was hands down one of the best dining experiences of my life. Started out with an hour and a half queue in the cold, which could easy have ruined an evening out. However the wait flew by thanks to the rounds of free warm tea and chocolate-bourbon chai. The hostesses were friendly and accommodating and before we knew it we were waiting inside at the bar. The cocktails are great. I had the Bombay Bellini, consisting of raspberries, lychees, rose & prosecco. Seriously delicious. Like if I had one wish it would be for one of those to appear magically in my hand whenever I was hot and looking to cool down, or just at all times. When we were seated the waitress walked us through the menu. The food is tapas style, several small plats ranging from £2-£8. My boyfriend and I split veggie samosas, paneer tikka (jesus christ that paneer), a lamb rice dish, garlic naan and this fantastic black daal. Everything was incredible, the best Indian food of my life. I was floored by how flavorful (and cheap!) everything was. There was plenty of food for the two of us and our bill rounded up to a lovely £56,81. So yeah the food is to die for and the cocktails are delicious, but what really put my visit to Dishoom over the top was the service. Every single staff member was so genuine and friendly, with out being over the top. Attentive and warm, with plenty of helpful information regarding the menu items. When I mentioned to the manager how impressed I was she bought us a round of drinks! Like what?? What is this magical place of delicious affordable wonderment? It's Dishoom. That's what it is. 5/5 all the way."
11/3/2016,4 star rating,"My friend and I waited outside for about 20 minutes but were offered hot drinks (nice sherry by the way !) by nice staff. Diner was very good and good value, staff very nice. We recommend !"
12/2/2017,4 star rating,Fantastic ambience with tapas style Indian street food. Amritsari fish is a star; wish the rest of the small plates were as tasty. Bar is really small but the cocktails are great with an Indian twist. Have been here multiple times over the last few years and have observed the service and food quality dropping and not sure if their growth has caught up with their neglect towards customers.
16/5/2017,5 star rating,"Dishoom is one of the best authentic Indian restaurants in London! The dishes are very delicious and the sizes of the portions very good too! 'Well done!' to the chefs who let us taste proper Bombay food :) Our experience wouldn't have been the same without a great customer service. Our waiter, Mo Ali, took great care of us that evening, served us with a smile, recommended good dishes and was attentive at all times. A big thumbs up to him! It's a must to go to Dishoom. They don't take reservations for small groups; there's a queue, but worth the wait! The front of house staff will make sure you try some Indian chai, among other yummy drinks! Looking forward to visiting Dishoom again!"
22/5/2016,5 star rating,"Spectacular! This location was large and elaborately decorated to mimic the Bombay Irani cafes of the early 1900s. From the tables and chairs, to the wall decor and bar setup, entering this restaurant is as if you had entered a time capsule back to early twentieth century India. The menu is presented tapas style, and every dish I tired I thoroughly enjoyed! We started with the masala prawns (very large, exquisitely seasoned prawns!) and the lamb samosas (very light filo with tender pieces of lamb). Next we shared the Awadhi Lamb (again, a wonderful seasoned biryani dish) and ordered a side of Roomali Roti (this was our only disappointment, since the roti seemed a bit tough). The Dishoom Chicken Tikka Roll was also  very flavorful, and enough to share for 2! For dessert, try the Pineapple and Black Pepper Crumble - not too sweet and a perfect end to the meal.  The waiter was attentive, and service flawless. I only wish I lived in London to sample more of their menu! This is a restaurant you want to keep coming back to for its sheer uniqueness and top notch service!"
15/5/2015,4 star rating,"Three reasons to love Dishoom: (1) The cool Bollywood-inspired name (2) The reasonable prices for the location (3) The quality of the food No, this is not the best Indian restaurant in London. (That title goes to Montys in Ealing.) But it does what it does well and efficiently. Portions are right-sized. They have an efficient system by which to handle the steady flow of customers that contributes to the experience & atmosphere rather than detract. Service is very friendly... especially for the location / reputation. Prices are downright good for the location. Menu is limited in a way that suggests that they are more interested in making good dishes than in pleasing all."
10/7/2014,4 star rating,"This is a great place if you're looking for an authentic taste. I was shocked to see the line of people waiting to eat there but after my meal, I would wait also. It's worth it. Service is great and fast! Recommendations: garlic naan chicken ruby mattar paneer"
31/10/2017,2 star rating,"This is a very strange restaurant. Styled after Irani cafés of yore? LOL. No. Styled after PF Chang's? Quite possibly. Food is just fine--over-spiced and lacking subtlety or variety of flavor but made with fresh ingredients. A request for ""extra yogurt on side"" got me a vat of the stuff. Chai spice is VERY PRESENT but fails to complement the tea, masking it instead. The food may have the right components, but the soul necessary to combine them properly isn't there. The ambiance is Corporate Chain inside a Mall of America. Staff was pleasant!"
9/5/2017,4 star rating,Great indian Street food.  Great atmosphere. Not cheap but definitely worth a visit. Great Central London location with vintage decor
9/5/2017,5 star rating,"The best Indian food I've ever had. Service was great, there was a line out the door but only took 15 minutes to get in. Food was 5-STAR."
24/12/2018,4 star rating,This is a wonderful restaurant with plenty of choices. For the most part the food is spicy however they have nice options for other entrees. The wait is about 40 minutes but well worth it!!
7/2/2019,5 star rating,"OMG---this place is amazing!!  We waited in line for about 45 min but the food was so worth it!! The line moved fast and they gave us free chai tea. Overall, I was wary b/c I've had bad experiences with super spicy indian food.  To my pleasant surprise, everything we had was overflowing with flavor yet nicely balanced.  We had the okra fries, chicken ruby, dishoom slaw, lamb boti kabab, garlic naan, black daal and chocolate pudding.  The black daal was my favorite!!  It's great for dipping with naan or over rice--just so much flavor.  The service was excellent.  Our busy waiter took time to explain menu items and offer suggestions which made the overall experience even better!"
10/7/2017,5 star rating,Awesome Food with Great service!! A must go place if you like Indian food
20/1/2016,5 star rating,"I'm not going to write how great dishoom is or how long the wait might be (read the below reviews, you will get the point). I think what is good about dishoom that your waiter might not mention is that the dishes are larger than regular tapas so if you're a group of 3 and thinking of ordering 9 dishes, you might be overdoing it. Think of each dish as shareable between 2 people as taste tasting and order accordingly."
19/1/2014,5 star rating,"Been here several times now for breakfast and I have yet to have a bad experience here. All food items have been great. Service is quite nice. It's just been really great. Drink: House Chai - this has been one of the best chai I've had in a while. No need to explain, you should just get this. Fresh Mint Tea - comes in a pot and has mint notes that seem to satisfy you immediately as you take deep breathes through the nose. Good subtle flavors for your morning wake me up. Food: Bombay Omelette - Pretty straight forward dish, omelette with a hint of spice together with onion and tomatoes. The side of vine tomatoes that are grilled are a very nice add when having the omelette and bread together. Fresh Fruit and Yoghurt - This is a surprisingly good dish. Simply put together with yoghurt and various fruits like raspberries, blueberries, strawberries and honeydew. The vanilla beans are visible on the yoghurt and add the great vanilla flavor along with the tart and sweet fruits. Bacon Naan Roll - ummmmm bacon... can't go wrong. That chili tomato jam with cream cheese is a nice combination. It's pretty sweet, but goes well with the salty, savory bacon wrapped up in the naan bread. Would love to come here for their dinner service, but so far has not gone wrong during breakfast."
15/3/2016,5 star rating,"The BEST Indian food and FANTASTIC service! We were visiting from Los Angeles to celebrate my mom's bday. Our server Arlind was so helpful and attentive. The manager very sweetly checked on us. When it came time for dessert, Arlind kindly gathered all the attractive servers to gather and sing happy birthday with so much spirit! We had such a blast! Truly made our trip special. We will definitely be back!! Thanks again!"
9/3/2018,5 star rating,"This is really good even if you haven't really had Indian food before. There's lots of options for everyone. There's vegetarian options, vegan and even Keto and dairy free options. Don't go during normal eating hours unless you want to wait in line for ever. If you go during non normal eating hours you will be seated quickly and get good service and probably have a better experience."
25/4/2015,4 star rating,"I love this place - the Covent Garden version seems less trendy than the Shoreditch place (quelle surprise!) but has the same yummy food and is therefore the sort of place where our eyes are always heaps bigger than our tummies so always end up having to lug lots of yummy food home (no real shame of course!) Also super good value and there are some yummy, well-made cocktails and lassis too! The only real (slight) downside is that you can't book but even though the queue is always miles long, it always moves reasonably quickly because another benefit of the yummy street food is that it is made, served and gobbled up pretty fast!"
18/1/2017,5 star rating,"Never disappoints.  Worth the wait.  Flavor spectacular and a tight ship once seated, despite the usual long wait at the front end. Go early ;)"
2/11/2016,5 star rating,"Why can't you be in NYC?!?! We stumbled upon a line outside Dishoom when looking for a place for dinner while visiting London. They said it would be a 50 minute wait...UGH....we're tied and hungry....other in the line insist it is worth the wait and they're all locals. We opt to wait....someone comes out with a tray of Chai tea in shot glasses. The time passes quickly and we get in the door and are handed a pager. We're ushered to the downstairs small bar area. The drink menu is unique, I opt for a non-alcholic watermelon and mint drink that was outstanding and fresh. We wait a few minutes when the pager goes off and we are brought to this huge table that is a horseshoe shaped private booth...it's intimate, quiet and out of the way. The service is great as they explain that everything is ment to me shared, and suggest we get 7-9 dishes for the 3 of us. Not knowing the portion size we order 2 of the vegetable Biriyani. It turns out to be too much and sadly we can't take it home with us. Everything is different and unique. Grilled shrimp were to die for. Cheese bread!! The dessert chocolate pudding was pure heaven. This place would be worth a trip back, it truly was a fabulous restaurant, fantastic staff and service, decor and food!!! FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!! FYI, NYC is hungry and waiting!!!"
7/12/2013,5 star rating,"This is probably one of the best restaurants in the world.  Period. Ambience: Clean, quirky, always vibrant and friendly. Ingredients: Excellent.  I want to buy groceries where they buy them. Flavors: Subtle and amazing.  My bouche is amused every single time.  And even with the main courses that I eat regularly, every time, the flavors are phenomenal. My favorites: nearly everything on the menu. Now if only the lines outside were shorter!"
30/8/2016,5 star rating,"Love this restaurant.  A great place to go for a pre theatre dinner as service is very efficient. Food is excellent. Love the ruby chicken and the black daal. Excellent signature mocktails with watermelon.  Yes, you have to get there early; but it is worth the wait."
29/8/2016,4 star rating,Great food! Very good staff that is eager to make an effort to get things right (my old fashioned drink was not an old fashioned until the 3rd try). A pleasure to visit and lives up to the hype. Give it a try!
24/8/2018,5 star rating,"Dinner at Dishoom was amazing. We waited for probably 30 minutes for a party of 2 late on a Saturday night, but they had originally guessed it to be 90 minutes...so we were pleasantly surprised. The chicken ruby, garlic naan, cheddar naan, lamb chops, house black daal, and a side of white rice was 44 pounds total (and more than enough food). All SO delicious!"
9/4/2017,4 star rating,"I've been before and love this place. Great, REAL Indian food, and I'm Indian! My main piece of advice is to go at an off-peak time and avoid the rush. I am a bit bummed to see a reduction in their vegetarian options since I was last here in 2013, though :/ Hope they bring these back!"
7/4/2017,5 star rating,Crazy energy here! Food was amazing! Can't wait to go back!
9/6/2017,5 star rating,"I've only been here for breakfast, which is the easiest time of day to get a table. It's already bustling at 8am, but the wait staff are super friendly, and I looooveeee the dish with chicken liver."
14/9/2013,5 star rating,"This was our first dinner in London on our honeymoon and are we glad we went! Everything we had was absolutely delicious. The standouts were the black daal, chicken thighs, slaw, and of course the  pistachio kulfi (get one per person, amazeballs!). This restaurant reminded me why people adore indian food. I so wish that we were able to enjoy Indian food such as this in the states."
20/6/2017,3 star rating,"Visiting my son in London is always cool. I always find something new and interesting.  Best food i have had in London, Indian food tastes really great!!"
7/8/2016,4 star rating,"Food was excellent, and the service was good, but was very loud, and they seemed a little disorganized. Had a better experience at the Soho location, but would still recommend for the tasty Indian food."
25/9/2013,5 star rating,"Ah,  Dishoom. How I have been waiting to eat your delectable creations. Finally, I had my chance. Upon walking up to Dishoom, my husband and I noticed a ridiculously long line. Unfortunately for groups less than six people, reservations are not possible - get here early and prepare to wait in line (a long time if you're unfortunate) to get inside. Those wishing the battle the wait can either go downstairs to the tiny bar and enjoy refreshments or be served complimentary goodies (like masala chai) while waiting in line outside for which I applaud them. Very good manners, Dishoom. Well played. Our line was supposed to be an hour long but as luck would have it, we waited less than 20 some minutes and were escorted inside to our table. The inside of Dishoom looks like what tea houses and cafes looked like in Bombay before they all started to disappear. Having gone to India in February, I was feeling nostalgic looking at all of the old Hindi film posters and black and white photographs. We were greeted immediately by our sever who asked us if we had ever eaten at Dishoom before. She guided us through the menu and suggested how we order - Dishoom is a small plates type of restaurant. It's best to order several items per person and share them. Dishes come out as soon as they're ready, so be prepared to receive items piping hot and in a random order. The cocktail list was interesting. Instead of ordering wine, we started with a Jack Daniels and Coke (for the husband) and a Bollybellini (for me). Opting to avoid our usual extravaganza of paneer dishes while eating out at an Indian restaurant, we ordered the pau bhaji, the house black daal, bowl of greens, rice, rajma frankie and gunowder potatoes. Everything was excellent - I don't need to go into the particularities of each dish. All I'll say is next time, I'll order a paneer dish, skip the greens and daal (although it's famous, I've had better. The pau bhaji was absolutely excellent (you can taste the butter) but more bread should be served with such a big portion. We each also sampled more cocktails - Edwina's Affair (or Edwina's something) and the Bombay Pimms and skipped dessert - we were far too stuffed to order more food, although we considered it more than once. Dinner was pricey but worth it. Service was friendly and attentive. Everything was sparkling clean and the restaurant itself appears to run like a well-oiled machine. Downstairs in the bathroom, behind glass cases are very vintage looking Indian medicines to cure all sorts of remedies - a very interesting and thought-provoking display for those who have visited India. We will most definitely be back!"
25/3/2014,5 star rating,"This was probably my favorite meal during my recent trip to London. I had been wanting to check it out since my last business trip when two separate co-workers had tried it and came back with positive reviews. Our party of four had to wait a little over an hour to get in, but the time went by quickly. The hostesses that managed the line were very friendly, and I loved the chai and mint tea they brought out to the line to keep us warm. My favorites of the night were the fried skate cheeks and okra from the appetizer/small plates menu as well as the lamb biryani and chicken ruby (curry) from the main entrees menu. Heck, everything was delicious though; I really doubt that you can go wrong with your ordering here. We rounded out the evening with sulfis all around for dessert. The pistachio sulfi was absolutely marvelous; you've got to try it! Anyway, I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in London. So, so good!"
7/10/2018,3 star rating,"It was a good experience.  We've been curious to try this place, but every time we check it out, there's a long line outside the door.  Oddly, it wasn't that busy around noon on a weekday.  By the time we left though, there was that long line outside again.  The service was pretty good.  The food was not bad.  Maybe, I overhyped myself about this place.  It sure is popular in Covent Garden, but I would eat here again if someone else paid :) Otherwise, I wouldn't crave it."
30/7/2013,5 star rating,"Normally I am very skeptical of hip Indian restaurant. I eyed calamari on the menu, and automatically wondered what in god's name has globalization done to us. What self-respecting Indian restaurant serves Mediterranean/Italian fare? Man was I wrong. Hip or not, dishoom has amazing Indian food. Don't believe me? Eye up the clientele. The best way to figure out whether an Indian place is legit is to find older Indian patrons. If they are satisfied, then you sure as hell don't have any excuse not to be. Dishoom was bursting with Indians, and large portion of them were older :) For our food we ordered the Ruby Chicken, Kacchi Lamb Biryani with a side of Raita, and Roomali Roti. The Ruby Chicken was amazing. Perfectly complex, seasoned, and spicy. The biryani had prize pieces of Lamb. I am so used to getting sub par meat in Biryani, but the meat here was excellent. The raita was hands down the best I have ever had...creamy, thick, and cool. I only ordered one Roomli roti, but I honestly wish my own family could make roti as good as this one. All in all a wonderful meal and I can not wait to head back."
15/6/2018,5 star rating,"wow wow wow. this place is amazzzzzing. from the service, food, and atmosphere. it was an absolute experience. my favorite dishes were the vegetable samosa and chicken tikka."
17/3/2017,5 star rating,"This place was excellent! After quite a long queue, 1hr 10, everything was so good. The aesthetics are lovely, you feel unrushed without the service suffering, and while the portions LOOK small they are deceivingly filling and full of flavor. I would highly recommend this restaurant (at perhaps a less busy hour) but nonetheless recommend it, as it was wonderful from food, to ambiance, to service."
13/12/2016,5 star rating,"Worth waiting. We got confused about the menu, staff was really nice to explain"
12/3/2017,5 star rating,"Dishoom is absolutely worth the glowing reviews - better than we could have imagined. Came for a 30th birthday celebration and it delivered on all accounts - drinks, food, service and atmosphere. Nice work Dishoom!"
23/11/2018,5 star rating,My party of 4 had an excellent dinner last night (USA Thanksgiving). Every dish was amazing. We eat Indian very frequently but Dishoom was one of the best I have experienced. We arrived about 8 pm & had to wait about 50 minutes but this was expected based on prior reviews. We found seats near the bar & nursed our drinks while waiting. Service staff was attentive & did an excellent job. Every dish was well prepared & very tasty.
14/4/2014,5 star rating,We ordered: OKRA FRIES: This was a little too dry. My friend actually loved it bc of that. This was my least favorite CHICKEN RUBY. OMG... this was so good. I could have licked the bowl clean CHEESE NAAN: this was really good. ordered it for my daughter. reminded me of a quesadillas with green onions ROMALI ROTI: this was good for soaking up all the sauces! HOUSE BLACK DAAL: this was good. great with the BASMATI RICE. MARSALA PRAWNS.. this was so good! RAITA: this you need to have to eat with the rest of the dishes I'm so sad I'm leaving London bc I will be craving Dishoom's Chicken Ruby!
9/1/2019,4 star rating,"While visiting the area, after seeing excellent review at yelp for dinner, I stopped there. There was a line for guests outside, thus my expectations were high. While in line, they served free hot india masala tea. Hosts were efficient and organized. Server and ambience was very good. I ordered kali Dal, garlic Naan and another item. Honestly, Food was tasty (but not exceptional). I will not wait for 50 mins in cold weather. If no wait, then worth visiting."
19/11/2013,5 star rating,"The decor is cozy, vintage, and modern.  The service is great.  The food is even better.   We ordered the calamari, house black daal, kacchi lamb, and masala prawns.  All were delicious but my favorite dishes were the calamari and house black daal.  The calamari was perfectly fried and seasoned.  The house lack daal was rich and complemented all of the other dishes.  I wish I discovered this place earlier!"
26/11/2013,5 star rating,"My tummy still smiles when I think about the meal I had here, and my eyes cry, because it's located over 3,000 miles away now.  While visiting London, my husband and I put Indian Food high on the culinary priority list, and my fellow yelpers did not steer me wrong.  We enjoyed calamari, lamb samosas, naan and a chicken curry dish that I wish I could remember the name of.  Every bite was better than the last, and our server was friendly, attentive, efficient and ready with a recommendation or two! Do make reservations, even on a week night.  We were there on a Tuesday night with a reservation, and were seated immediately, whereas the wait was already a half an hour otherwise.  By the time we finished dinner, there was a line down the block."
17/9/2018,5 star rating,"Returned to Dishoom after an excellent experience several years ago. I decided to forgo the dinner wait and go for lunch on my first afternoon in London. Quality of the food is still impressive and the drink I had at the bar while I waited for my table also didn't disappoint. Will probably make this a regular stop whenever I visit London, if only so I can try other items off the menu."
26/5/2014,4 star rating,"There are plenty of Indian restaurants in London and despite that this one usually has a queue out the door. That many people can't be wrong and in good groupthink fashion I went with the crowds and after my experience I was happy I did. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Indian cuisine was unfamiliar to us so the server gave us a thorough rundown of the menu. In the end we left it up to our server and we were rewarded with a flurry of tastes and spices. Yes, this is bold and dangerous at an Indian restaurant. However, the food was colorful, flavorful, aromatic, and some dishes, not all, were spicy. The cheese naan can and should be dipped in just about any of the sauces accompanied by the food. Order a kingfisher beer which compliments the spicy food. Don't be afraid to use your hands! For dessert they offer these ice cream Popsicles in a variety of flavors. Do get one."
3/10/2013,5 star rating,"So this is the spot we picked for our one dinner in London, and it did not disappoint. We came after watching the Lion King, and arrived around 10:30pm. No wait and was seated right away. Food - Veggie Samosas, Chiken Tikka, Black Daal, Garlic Naan and my wife and I were in heaven! Everything was fantastic and very authentic. With one alcoholic drink, the meal was around $50, which I felt was very worth it. I also must mention that the food came out super quick. Interior- so very nice and modern, while still keeping their heritage. The bathroom was even awesome. I highly recommend this place! It's so nice to be able to use Yelp internationally and find places like this."
18/5/2016,3 star rating,"My friend took me to Dishoom in London calling it a restaurant which would hit very close to India. The reviews amongst Londoners I met prior to the meal were something along the lines of ""Best Indian restaurant"", ""Daal is to kill for"", etc., So with absurdly high expectations, we hit the restaurant at around 9:30 PM. Waited for 10 minutes and managed to get a spot at the bar with a further estimated wait time of 15 minutes for the actual table. At the bar, we ordered Okra fries and Samosa. Samosa - Tasted pretty much like Trader Joes frozen samosas heated up. Okra fries - Underwhelmed. No crispness to it. Favors didn't stand out either. After around 10 minutes of wait time, we got our table. I was willing to let go of the samosa and okra fries and give Dishoom a second chance. We ordered Vada Pav, Bhel Puri, Daal, Bread and Biryani. Vada Pav - Good. Not a home run, but good. Bhel Puri - Disaster. Where are my chutneys?! Why am I eating this bland puffed rice? I mixed in the chutneys from the Samosa to save the day. Daal - Really really good. They got their signature dish right. Biryani - I guess it was Kachi Biryani. Please don't tell me this is Dum. If I am trying to guess the biryani types, you know the biryani is in trouble. All I can say was it was some sort of curry rice. Outside of India, the restaurants worthy of mention are Himalaya in Houston, Texas, Vij in Vancouver, Canada, Rasika/Bombay Club in Washington DC, Indian Accent in New York. Dishoom is nowhere close. If I was in London, I would be visiting it yea, but not recommending it as the next best thing outside India."
4/9/2018,5 star rating,"Its worth the wait. The staff is great, very pleasant while you wait in que and so is the wait staff. Food is awesome! I came back twice in the week we were here and was not disappointed.  This is a must when in London!"
14/11/2018,5 star rating,A long wait for dinner but it was totally worth it. They served little cups of chai while we waited which was yummy.
16/5/2018,5 star rating,"Best Indian. I just went to India for work a few months ago. It does not get better than this. We had the ruby chicken, black daal, garlic naan, house shrimp dish. Everything was delicious"
23/11/2015,4 star rating,"Really  great Indian food here. I used live in Bradford in Yorkshire a place with a lot of wonderful Indian restaurants. I have to say this place is amazing , not only for its authentic indian dishes and atmosphere, but also for its innovation fusion dishes, really delicious, inspiring."
9/2/2019,5 star rating,Everything here was delicious. We had the chili chicken which tasted just like the chicken my husbands mother makes- and the chaat was fresh and bright- and the samosas with the perfect amount of heat and with cinnamon to give it sweetness. The atmosphere was lively and confit and the service was very good. 5 stars!
29/10/2013,4 star rating,"I haven't (yet) embraced the idea of queuing outside for 45mins for a burger & chips, but I'm happy to queue up for Dishoom for some reason. Okay, actually for three reasons: 1) they give you free boozy chai outside, 2) once in, you wait in the cool little bar downstairs, and 3) the food is good. Okay fine, it's *mostly* the free bourbon-spiked chai! When it comes to Indian restaurants, if a place can make me forget my 'it's no mum's cooking!' feelings and come back for more, then I figure it's doing something right. Dishoom with its bustling Bombay teahouse feel is definitely doing so. From the low hanging glass lamps (like wiring was an afterthought), old family photos on the walls and vintage medicines and toiletries on display in the loos, everything invites you in for a closer look. Food-wise everyone will have their faves, but I've found the bhel has a great kick, pau bhaji is yum (though I like mine with more onion on top) and the house black daal is worth a try. Need to go again with some non-veggies to try more meat dishes I think but skip the lamb boti kabab (other grills yet to be investigated), and get a side of okra fries no matter what else you're having. Drinks-wise there's a nostalgia hit for me from getting chai in authentic glass cups, and seeing Limca on the menu (basically it's their 7UP - my sis and I got addicted to this on a childhood trip to India!). Fusion cocktails work with differing degrees of success - wasn't much chai in the chaijito but the bombay pimms was better. Still working on trying them all. The overall package is a hit for me anyway. Decent value dishes too, though the whole small-plate-sharing thing always means you end up ordering loads! Though it always seems to get finished off somehow... :)"
13/8/2013,3 star rating,Dishoom is handily located in the heart of Covent Garden and as a result it was packed out at 10 pm on a Sunday evening when I paid it a visit. The place smells amazing but the food didn't quite live up to the aromatic promise. I ordered the chicken ruby (extra kudos for them using cockney rhyming slang) along with rice but it doesn't really compete with some of the curries I have had in London for a cheaper price. Solid but not spectacular.
29/8/2016,5 star rating,"Very impressed with the food !! It was flavorful , delicious and I loved the size of the portions , great for sharing !!!!  Recommend trying the Ruby chicken and the lamb kebabs . The lamb is so tender it literally melts in your mouth. As for cocktails the chilitini is the the best cocktail I have ever had !!!! A must try is you like something semisweet , refreshing with a spicy kick at the end. Cannot wait to come back and eat here again."
12/2/2017,4 star rating,"Absolutely loved dhishoom! V friendly staff and the food was great. We ordered the panner and mango salad plate, dhishoom chicken tikka, black daal, dhishoom chocolate pudding, biryani, naan and rumali roti. The star of theshow were the daal and pudding, daal was the right amount of butter and spices and the kashmiri lal mirch icecream was outstandingly balanced between sweet and spicy."
22/6/2016,5 star rating,"If you don't want to wait in line, get here early! But the wait might be worth it. We had the lamb boti kabab and chicken ruby, washed down with the Viceroy's Old-Fashioned. The lamb was tender and delicious. I'm not a huge fan of lamb but i had absolutely no complaints. Although the chicken ruby was good, it wasn't incredible. It seemed more of the usual Indian/Pakistani food that you could get in London (which is great overall). I could eat their plain and garlic naan all day."
1/2/2014,5 star rating,"I love this place. Dishoom was recommended to me before I moved to London by an Indian friend born and raised in London and another local. I really didn't understand what 'Indian street food' is and how this is any different than other Indian places I've been. Well it is. I've brought multiple people whenever they are visiting from the US. I think it was best when my best friend, claims to be a staunch hater of Indian food, agreed to eat there and proclaimed she could find items she liked. Ca ching. Ordering: House Black Daal is a MUST. So buttery, so smooth. I dream about this. I really enjoy the murgh malai. Very tender chicken. Note it might come out pink but it is cooked through (don't be scared).  Definitely add one or two orders of the garlic naan. Other food dishes (just not as awesome) include pau bhaji (spicy). Chicken berry britannia (unique with the cranberries) and chicken ruby. There is always a queue as they don't accept evening reservations for groups under 6. The staff working the door are friendly and they bring you hot chai while you wait. You may also find yourself singing 'warm kitty' in queue. Continuing on service, each time I have gone all servers have had a smile on their face and been very helpful. But my favorite is Sapna. Beautiful, friendly, helpful with ordering - she is a gem at Dishoom. Enjoy your meal. You won't regret it."
10/4/2015,4 star rating,"I have eaten at dishoom as a vegetarian but this was my first trip as a vegan. Unfortunately the menu is quite limited - one main dish and several side dishes. HOWEVER I have to say that the caliber of the dishes that are available is so high that I was more than happy with my lot. The okra fries remain a stable favourite not matter what your dietary requirement. I also had the bhel puri, whcih was crunchy, sweet and very light. For the main course I had: Rajma-Chawal - A generous helping of slow-cooked spiced kidney beans ladled over a bowl-full of fragrant basmati rice. Red onion and raita served alongside. A most soothing and hearty dish. And it certainly was all of those things! In terms of drinks: If you're a fan of the pina colada the Bombay Colada is a must. Slightly frozen, ever so sweet and totally refreshing!"
24/10/2016,5 star rating,Pretty impressive Indian food. Quite authentic as my Indian colleague verified. Consistent quality every time I return. It might take some time to get seated so come early or be prepared. Portions are medium so you might need to order several items to be really full. Great place to try Indian food.
14/2/2014,5 star rating,Breakfast here was amazing ! It was absolutely delish! Customer service was just as wonderful as the food was ! Everyone was so nice and very helpful!
2/3/2016,5 star rating,"This review is from November of 2015. I am from the states and I am still dreaming of Dishoom. Take my review for what it is; as I do not think enough adjectives can describe just how fantastic my meal here was. If I visited Dishoom in the earlier part of my trip, I would've been a regular throughout my entire stay(I went twice during my last two days in London). Absolutely fantastic service, delicious food(the garlic naan and the black daal...!!! Incredible.) a wonderful staff. At first I thought they were just treating me well since I was a solo diner, but no--this service was beautifully delivered in a non-transactional way to all guests in the dining room. Dishoom, you deserve the utmost applause--fantastic service and a fantastically consistent product!"
20/3/2014,4 star rating,"After walking by a couple of nights in a row and seeing the line go down the block, decided to drop in early on a Friday evening and was lucky enough to snag a table just ahead of the dinner rush. My lamb biryani came straight out of the oven with the dough seal still on the lid and was delicious, along with the garlic naan.  Nice atmosphere and great food means I'll be back the next time I'm passing through."
16/1/2017,3 star rating,"Ok so many people have been hyping about this place I just had to give it a try. Unfortunately I really wasn't THAT blown away, it was good don't get me wrong however I won't be rushing back. But would definitely try it again, hoping that my first experience was just a bad-ish/average experience."
5/12/2015,5 star rating,"The food was outstanding, I wanted to stay all night to try everything on the menu. There was a mix up with our reservation but the staff went above and beyond to make sure we got a table immediately, despite the long line. The excellent service continued inside and you quickly realize this place is extremely well managed. Highly recommended!"
14/1/2017,4 star rating,I'm always on the look out for great indian. it was a cold rainy saturday and there was a queue. good thing i had reservations . i was seated at the end of a common table upstairs. i had the chicken ruby with rice...smooth gravy yumbo. also the lamb chops which had a nice chew but had more fat than meat. the corn came properly grilled and looked very tempting but was overwhelmingly salty(the waiter was apologetic and took it off the cheque).the chicken tikka was moist and the lamb kebobs a much better bet.ill come back for a round of frankies next time.
5/10/2018,5 star rating,Amazing food! Everything is so good and tasty! The waiter helped us out with the menu without us asking. But it is very popular so get there early!
4/10/2018,4 star rating,"Dishoom brings a freshness and uniqueness when it comes to Indian restaurants. The decor is thoughtful and intentional- it pulls through all of the fun and interesting things I saw growing up as an American Indian. All of the toiletries, movie references like the word Dishoom itself. It's a phrase like ""pow"" scene in superhero comics associated with a fighting scenes in Indian films. So it's fun, nostalgic and curious to be in the place. The food is also an elevated experience - the food options I'd say are classic choices - Phav Bhaji, Samosas, Matar paneer, etc. they taste really good though and have an extra pop. Drinks are great. I like their Bellini."
21/1/2016,5 star rating,"There is always a long wait to get in here, but it's sooo worth it. The food and drinks are amazing as well as the atmosphere. Would recommend it to anyone."
20/5/2018,5 star rating,Delicious Indian food with a really nice ambiance inside the restaurant. There is always a wait so either be prepared to wait or try to make a reservation.  They also have a nice selection of beer and wine.
1/8/2013,5 star rating,"I absolutely loved this Indian restaurant. It was the only one I ate at on my GB trip (unfortunately), but I'm so glad it was this one because it was some of the most unique Indian flavors I've ever had. Everything we had was flavorful and delicious. The only dish that the group thought was meh was the spicy lamb chops. Decor here has a gastropub feel and I loved it. My favorite dishes: Chicken berry britannia and chole chawal"
2/10/2014,4 star rating,"Nice deco and excellent service good food   average price for 3 dishesa  GBP 39, nice area 3 min by walking from five guys ,"
19/7/2016,3 star rating,"Many people had told us this place was overrated, and it is. Nonetheless, it is worth your time to decide for yourselves. The wait was 45 minutes on Monday night, but they offered free lime juice and chai while we waited. The staff were attentive, friendly and helpful. Food came within 20 minutes of ordering and was nice and hot. The most famous dish is the black daal, which was wonderful. Chicken ruby also a delight. Roomali roti was a nice compliment to the white rice. The paneer roll was really badly prepared, however, and I ended up feeling sick after eating it. It was flavorless and nothing like you get in India or NYC. This was a real disappointment. Overall, worth checking out and deciding for yourself. Try what they're known for."
2/4/2014,5 star rating,Only been once for after-work drinks... a yummy thumps up float followed by quite possibly the most amazing pistachio kulfi in the world... this is the kinda place that makes me miss London Love the decor and vintage bollywood vibe ..so trendy & fitting for The Great Indian meal :)
30/9/2018,4 star rating,"Just had drinks on a Thursday night. They have an amazing range of drinks, although not the cheapest. Particularly recommend the old fashioned and the hoppy paanch."
2/1/2013,5 star rating,"Splendid selection of Indian dishes. Some unusual, some simple, all amazingly tasty. Fast friendly service and great atmosphere and decor. Recommended."
8/1/2016,5 star rating,"I've been to dishoom for the breakfast before and I wasn't disappointed. They had a very Creative take on the traditional English breakfast by giving it an Indian twist, full of spice and goodness. I heard its also good for dinner and lunch, but haven't had the chance to try it yet (queues can get Super Long). But hey, that's always a sign of good things right? Will try to beat the queue next time, remember to try their chai tea as well!"
25/9/2016,4 star rating,"Great food, lively place, a bit loud and chaotic... Enjoyed dinner and a few well crafted drinks..."
6/12/2018,2 star rating,"HONESTLY..... i need to know why this restaurant is so hyped up. We were told by friends and family that this restaurant is a must go even if you do not like indian food, and we waited in line for an hour and half to be seated. The menu is extremely limited, THEY DONT EVEN HAVE TIKKI MASALA. I have had 100x better Indian food back home... extremely let down with this restaurant."
6/12/2018,3 star rating,OK -- good but DEFINITELY not worth the hype. I was told this is the #1 restaurant to go to in London and it was simply just regular Indian food. I waited in the cold for an hour which I was willing to do but was let down with what we got.
13/7/2016,5 star rating,The food was delicious and reasonably priced. I had the mahi tikka which was tender and moist along with the cheesy naan and a mango lassi that was very refreshing.  We also ordered raita for the table which was a pretty large side and refreshing with the curries. My friends had the black daal and the chicken ruby and they loved both as well. I also was able to try my friend's rose and cardamom last and it was delicious. The service was great and they let us sit at the table as we waited for our other friends to arrive instead of giving up the reservation. I recommend going at lunch to beat the crowd and cannot wait to return and try many of the other dishes on their menu.
12/7/2018,5 star rating,I've eaten at Dishoom's four times in the last two months and I don't even live in London (I'm from San Francisco). It's my go to Indian food when I visit. Every dish I've ever ordered has been delicious. The fried okra is a particular favorite.
5/12/2018,4 star rating,I was really surprised by this place. I passed by it a lot without thinking of trying it as I have to be in the mood to be trying a new Indian place. Wish I took the plunge earlier as the food and the place is great. No wonder its always packed. My main concern with Indian food is that its a bit heavy for my liking. Not Dishoom as it was great. Will go there again and again.
2/3/2017,5 star rating,"As always Dishoom is a delightful experience! The food and ambience is excellent, the service is extremely efficient and myself and my group were well looked after indeed. It made a nice difference to be able to book for lunch this time at the Covent Garden branch. We were pressed for time so it was great we did not have to queue. It was a first time visit for my friends (after I had recommended here) - and they were not disappointed. The food was delicious and came in a timely manner then we were left to enjoy it. One of my bug bears is waiting staff constantly checking on whether the food is ok etc but the staff have it just right here. Overall it's one of my favourite places to eat in town and there is no question myself and my friends will return!"
30/1/2016,2 star rating,"Disappointing given the rave reviews. I don't think anything really impressed, and I kind of wish we went to a more traditional Indian restaurant instead."
22/2/2016,5 star rating,"Delicious. I am not very savvy with Indian food so I never really know what to get, but everything I have had here has been great. Highly recommend."
13/3/2015,5 star rating,"Love this place! Book a both for brunch and order the sausage naan, it's the best. Bacon naan a close second and lots of healthier options too if you are feeling virtuous. Great location to go for a mooch in Covent Garden afterwards"
16/9/2014,3 star rating,"I think I need to come here one more time to taste the food here properly, the restaurant always very busy, always a very long queue outside and they don't do advance booking.  I waited at least 25 mins in the queue before I get a table. We order two rice dishes, both are similar, the food isn't as heavy as the other India restaurant."
19/12/2014,5 star rating,"Dishoom (Bombay Cafè, Covent Garden) Dishoom Dishoom, does it ring a bell? Well it's all in the name, an Indian version of the sound Kapow!!! - That exaggerated noise when a fist connects with the flesh of a baddie in a Bollywood film. Hmmmm, maybe I'm just a sucker for all things Bollywood, especially movies from the 1970's to 1995's, an era absolute epicenes and crazy dance moves. So when I was set on a mission to organize a much needed dinner date with my girlfriends, Dishoom was definitely a top choice with excellent reviews, not to mention its website which kind of got me captivated. So check it out guys here's the link: dishoom.com Having booked a table for 6:00pm, we were able to cut through the long queue and be seated promptly. read on here facebook.com/pages/Food-…"
1/12/2018,5 star rating,Excellent brunch. Had both their 'specialties' including breakfast naan and chai tea. Everything we ate was delicious and the service was great. Went mid week in the morning so wasn't very crowded but I've heard to expect a wait. All in all - it's worth it!
2/7/2018,5 star rating,"Wonderful Indian food.  There is always a line in front.  A word of advice, Dishoom does take reservations on-line before 6 pm. Do this a week before and you can bypass the long line of tourist in front. Favorite dishes include the chicken ruby, grilled lamb chops and don't forget the garlic naan!"
12/7/2015,5 star rating,"If there a perfect Indian meal to be had in London this might be it. If you can stomach the 40 minute outside wait followed by another 20 minutes inside then you're ready to find out. Right from the start when they serve complimentary chai and sherry to those waiting in line, all the way through the snacks and cocktails in the waiting bar downstairs Dishoom does its best to minimize the one negative thing it has going for it which is it's insane and totally warranted popularity (you may have to flag the waitress down in the bar though, if there's one obvious thing to improve its that they should hire a second waitress, I could see quite a few people frustratedly trying to get her attention even tho she was working her butt off, there were just too many people down there).  The fried squid was far more delicious and had a spicy depth that belied the  calamari-like appearance. The ruby chicken is a little standard but very good version of chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan sopped up the spicy hot juices bringing just a glimmer of sweat to my brow. The black daal was maybe a tad dryer than I would have liked but again full of deep flavours. The paneer tikka was amongst the best I've ever had, made better by a topical spice that gave the cheese a nice saltiness. The veg up sell was totally boring however but not enough to lose a star. The highlight was the lamb chops which compared to another famous Indian lamp chop from Tayyabs comes out the winner. Finally the plain kulfi pop dessert was an amazing light and fragrant way to end the meal along with another cup of their amazing chai (which unlike many is actually really spicy) Well worth the hype!"
27/4/2016,5 star rating,"I left so caffeinated from the unlimited chai. It was really good, great service.Even my friend who doesn't like Indian food was happy with her food. We went for breakfast before going to shop and see museums in the area. Highly recommend."
24/4/2016,4 star rating,"Lovely food! Their black lentils are what made me actually like lentils again! Definitely try their cinnamon icecream too, it is light, creamy and full of delicious cinnamon flavour. My only qualm is that you can only book for 6 or more people."
27/9/2015,4 star rating,Great experience and food. Good luck in getting a table!
24/4/2014,4 star rating,Pretty awesome! Rating of some of the food we tried here : Black dal - 9/10 Matar Paneer - 5/10 Pav Bhaji - 8/10 Rajma Chawal - 8/10 Breakfast scrambled egg - 1/5 (really oily)
7/3/2016,5 star rating,I have been to London 3 times in the past 6 months and I find myself at Dishoom each time. I love their Chicken Ruby and Samosas. Their Cheesy Nan is also delicious. Service is excellent from the queue all the way through paying your bill. Couldn't be more pleased.
20/6/2018,2 star rating,"I'm not certain what is the hype about. This is far from being a good indian place. The curry sauce tasted like italian tomato sauce with a touch of indian flavor, lacking the depth and richness of true indian dish. I must admit the naan bread and roti were very good otherwise I would've given them 1 star. If you want to experience indian food go where locals eat but this one is geared for tourists who unlikely to come back."
19/6/2016,5 star rating,"Made a quick trip to London while I was in Europe and was determined to try this place after reading all the reviews. I had really high expectations coming in and they were definitely all met! We got the black daal, chicken ruby, lamb biryani, garlic naan, okra fries and they were all sooooo well seasoned and delicious. We came around 7 and the wait was an hour and 20 minutes but we were seated after 40 minutes which was great. They also served free chai and mint teas since the weather was a little chilly outside. This place made me wish I lived in London because I would probably come every week!!"
8/5/2013,4 star rating,"Yummy! My impression of this place may be skewed since I was mad hungry. It was delicious nonetheless. Had the lamb biryani (yogurt that went with it was fresh and crisp), chicken ruby, and vegetable samosa - split with my friend. It was enough between the both of us. We also each ordered hard ciders, which were plenty for our tummies. The place itself is HUGE! We ate outside but I went inside to use the bathroom. Very cute design inside."
29/8/2013,5 star rating,"This place makes me wish I lived in London. I came here for a solo Sunday lunch and left thoroughly stuffed and satisfied. The house black daal (£4.90) was soul-warming, thick and mildly spiced, the ultimate comfort food. It was perfect scooped up with chewy roomali roti (£1.90) and naan (£1.90), both freshly baked. I think the thicker naan held the daal better than the roti, though both were delicious. I couldn't stop eating it, even on a scorching hot day! The naan and roti were also great with the chutneys on the table. I'd accept the cold London winters if I could eat this every day. Dessert was just meh. If a dessert is more expensive than my entree, it better be amazing, and the pineapple & black pepper crumble (£5.20) wasn't. That's not to say it was awful -- it wasn't too sweet and I could taste the black pepper in the topping. It paired well with the cinnamon ice cream, but after a heavy meal, I would have preferred just the ice cream, or one of the kulfis. The atmosphere was certainly unique. Loved the Bombay cafe decor. I never felt rushed, although I've heard the waits for dinner get quite long!"
30/8/2014,5 star rating,"Fabulous food!  We tried several of the plates and all agreed that the dahl and tikka chicken were the best, as was everything else we tried. The kids thought it was near the top of the Indian places we've tried and we would agree. We were a bit daunted by the line running out the front door and down the block (especially with 2 hungry kids in tow) but we stuck it out--and we are really glad we did! While waiting someone came and took our name and number of people, then someone else came and gave us free sample of their chai tea drink. A nice touch that made the wait easier to bear. After about 50 minutes we were seated. The whole process was very well organized and everyone was very friendly both during the wait and during dinner, often checking to see how we were doing. Highly recommend even if you have to wait."
27/11/2016,5 star rating,This might be my favorite restaurant in the world. I was in London for two days and went here twice. I recommend the Bollywood Bellini if you like sweet drinks.  The calamari and samosa were great . I has the Mahi tikka and the murgh malai. Fantastic! Also tried lamb chops and gunpowder potatoes and lamb and all the best I have ever had. If your in London please do here and you will not be disappointed . Service was great and the wait was about 15 minutes. The host gave us a chai tea latte while we waited.
14/6/2013,4 star rating,"When in London, one must always do Indian at least once. A sin if you don't. One of the things I look forward every time I'm here. My fiance and I were walking around and decide to pop in Dishoom. I'm usually skeptic of well manicure places as they usually atrac large numbers of tourists and eventually become tourist traps. But Dishoom was not the case. Nice decor, great service, even better food. One quick glance through the menu and this was the order. -Keema Pau -Murgh Malai -Dishoom Chicken Tikka -House Black Daal -Cheese Naan -Raita -Mango Fennel Lassi -Dishoom IPA Where to start? The beer, Dishoom IPA, is a house recipe brewed by a local brewery. Not like any IPA I have had before. Crisp, refreshing with notes of spices, it went perfect with the meal. The mango fennel lassi was incredibly smooth and tasty. The food was incredible. All of it. The bad part, I don't have anything like this close to home."
7/9/2013,5 star rating,"This place is awesome!  I went on a recent business trip to London and the waiter said they are planning to come to New York- I can't wait!   The food was excellent, as was the service.  Highlights included the roti, house black daal and the mutter paneer. Looking forward to going back!"
11/5/2015,5 star rating,"I've done it - completed the Dishoom triumvirate. This one is probably the most popular branch of the most popular old-Bombay-style restaurant in London. Right on Upper St Martin's next to Jamie's Italian, there's no hiding from the crowds and that keeps the line outside for weekend brunch consistently long. For us (four people), the wait was about 25 minutes. We were given a buzzer and invited to wait downstairs for a table, though other parties were made to wait outside - not sure why the separation. There is a whole science to the service at Dishoom, designed so the customers never go ANYWHERE unescorted. We were radioed into the restaurant by two hostesses, and then had to check in with the indoor hostess, who directed us downstairs to someone else who showed us where to wait. A fifth staffer brought us to our table, and finally we met the sixth and final staffer, our server. Service is always friendly and they certainly had one of the lowest staff-to-guests ratios I've seen of late. There are tons of staffers buzzing to and fro, one guy in the kitchen who just slaps out chapatis onto the stone oven, and one extremely tall dude whose job seemed to be walking around being extremely tall and good-looking. The only complaint was that we had to prompt for refills on our ""bottomless"" Chai - servers twice took away our empty glasses without offering refills. At Dishoom Shoreditch they always offer refills, so it sucks to have to be aggressive about the ""bottomless"" part here. Anyway, the food - as everyone and their mother have written - is stellar. Enhanced by a charming atmosphere with hanging lights, wooden tables and a general buzz in the air, this is a great place for a weekend catch-up brunch. The naan rolls were generously sized and freshly prepared, while the kerjiwal is greasy, cheesy, spiced, runny-yolk goodness. I liked how the toast didn't get soggy in the time it took to eat the dish. Be prepared for a bit of chaos, but it all goes down easy with the great food, warm service and fun dining room."
15/9/2015,3 star rating,"Ok. The food is nice but far too expensive, and the cost of drinks us through the roof"
26/5/2013,3 star rating,"Lamb chops were overrated. The potatoes were really weak... the chicken curry is not bad but not amazing. The Dahl had a good taste but once again, not amazing. The only thing that I really enjoyed were the Lamb Samosas. I may be spoiled with the Indian food in San Francisco and Bay Area but this place just was not special to me."
5/6/2018,5 star rating,Excellent Indian cuisine in a great setting in Edinburgh. Worth a walk for lunch. Right at St. Andrews square.
1/6/2018,5 star rating,"Love Dishoom, even with long waits as you can only book a table with a large party. Fun atmosphere, especially Kingscross and yummy Indian street food. Chicken Ruby is divine!"
15/11/2018,5 star rating,"It was a really good place, and we arrived there when it wasn't so busy. Highly recommend for a quick cheap eat."
1/6/2016,3 star rating,"Really busy restaurant. We manage to go one afternoon and we didn't need to queue. Indian food, but I wouldn't define it very authentic, small portions too and not very cheap, however, it is a very trendy place so I guess you pay for that."
15/4/2013,5 star rating,"Indian is by far my favourite food in the world and I have visited India several times so my standards are pretty high. In a town full of Indian restaurants I must say this place really delivers! They serve modern versions of the Mumbai areas classic dishes. The portions aren't big as they are meant for sharing. It is usually really busy so you might have to wait for a table, especially if you are a group. Everytime we have visited they have told us that we have to wait 30-40 minutes for a table but this has never happened. We have usually ended up waiting for only ca. 20-30 minutes max! They have a bar downstairs where you can enjoy some extremely tasty Lassi's while waiting (with or without rum). While waiting I would highly recommend the ""chili & cheese on toast""!"
10/2/2018,5 star rating,Eat here all the time.  Breakfast is delicious with naan egg sandwiches.  Dinner always good. Go to any location in London
26/3/2016,4 star rating,It's an experience more than food. There was long line on cold evening. Was told 90 mins wait (but got table in less than an HR) They served hot tea as we were standing which made waiting outside experience more like pub but with tea :-) Overall decor is old style Iranian restaurant in old Bombay which is quite nostalgic. Menu is best of old time favorites to typical fast food in India. Overall food good. Lamb Boti was very good. Chicken ruby is mediocre. So is biryani. But overall good experience.
25/3/2016,5 star rating,All around outstanding. Extremely organized service. Our food was delicious and our waiter was beyond helpful. Ruby chicken was our favorite. Great place.
11/11/2018,5 star rating,"This place was simply amazing. If you ever in London, this is a most stop. Please do not allow the wait to turn you away - well worth it."
9/11/2018,5 star rating,"Great food, deservedly popular. Weekend brunch is something a bit different, but once you've eaten you'll keep going back!"
9/11/2014,4 star rating,"The wait time was an hour or so-  but the staff were lovely and provided drinks beforehand. The waiter was pleasant but told us to order 3 dishes each- far too much food! The food was good, but too much for four of us. We nearly loved it, but didn't quite. Would be keen to tryit again but with less food this time! The chai was the best part of the meal by far."
5/8/2018,1 star rating,"Would give 0 stars! Very poor customer service. The two women up front who are ""helping"" to seat are very discriminative! They let people in according to their whims and fancies. Would not recommend this restaurant."
6/11/2016,5 star rating,Eat here and be happy.  1.5 hour wait at 8:30 pm on a cold Sunday night and STILL WORTH IT.
3/8/2018,5 star rating,Fantastic Indian with a great ambiance and solid cocktails. The wait is long but they have a great bar to grab drinks while you wait.
25/2/2013,4 star rating,"Not quite the best Indian I've had --- but really, really good!   With two pretty ladies in tow, we settled here for lunch -- it was awesome!   I must say, that this place is very hit or miss, to get a table!   Always busy during peak times, so make reservations, or roll the dice like we did!   The food is awesome -- the service, not as much!   Maybe they just get busy.   I was here a few times and the service wasn't all the great -- 5 tables occupied and 10 waiters standing around doing nothing.   Not even to refill a water glass.   Oh well. The food saves it here -- its fresh and really awesome!   Not be missed:  the House Black Daal -- totally rocking.   The chicken was awesome as well, so get that.   Take some time looking over the menu -- its extensive -- but worth it -- everything we ordered was good. If you've ever wanted to know what Bombay was like with the British influence, come here.   You'll get the idea quickly!"
19/5/2018,5 star rating,The service is top notch. Our server Bruno could not have been nicer or more welcoming!! The food was extraordinary and the atmosphere and ambiance some of the best I've experienced.
27/8/2013,5 star rating,"Great Indian food with very (very) strong flavors.  We didn't risk trying the dishes labeled as spicy.  Our favorite items were the bhel to start and the black daal.  To drink, the nimbu pani -- a ""light lemondrink to quench the thirst"" -- was incredibly tangy and refreshing.  Unfortunately, our service was a bit spotty -- our server completely forgot to get us water or chutneys.   There was a queue outside to be seated, complete with magic tricks and drinks.  We were brought down to the bar when space opened up and given a buzzer for when our table was ready, which ended up being sooner than they had told us."
2/11/2016,5 star rating,"My friend and I came for lunch and the food was great! We really enjoyed the lamb chops, as well as the butter chicken. The waiter was very nice and efficient, and he let us sample the black beans, which was a nice surprise. In fact, I brought a friend with me that day who has never been, and he loved Dishoom and said he would take his mother soon. I also came back for breakfast and we ordered the famous bacon naan and the Bombay style fry-up - both of which were delicious. We particularly enjoyed the deliciously spiced scrambled eggs in the fry-up. Most of all, the house chai is incredibly warming - a must try. Thanks for the delicious food, we'll be back! Jaroslav"
29/7/2016,5 star rating,Love this place. Great value for a posh Indian and the cocktails are amazing.
30/10/2016,5 star rating,"Great Indian food, being originally Indian, this is the best Indian food I've had in a restaurant- ever! My new too favorite , not heavy like some Indian restaurants quite comparable to home cooked Indian food absolutely divine"
15/5/2018,1 star rating,We stood in line for one hour for this. Everyone told me you must go. Seriously some of the worst Indian food I've ever had. Lamb chops were burnt to a crisp. Roti and naan were dry. The chicken curry Ruby which is their specialty is tasteless. The lamb biryani wasn't even edible. They are famous for cocktails. The bolly Bellini is sugar syrup. I would give this zero stars if I could. Horrible!
13/5/2018,5 star rating,"Best Indian food I've ever had, I wish they had restaurants in the states. I had the vegetable samosas,  prawn kaliwada, roti, and house black Dahl."
4/12/2013,5 star rating,"Loved the atmosphere, our server, and especially the food!  Definitely try the House Black Daal and for dessert definitely the Kulfi.  We got the pistachio, but I'm sure any of those flavors would be good.  Those were the standouts, but everything was delish!"
27/10/2016,5 star rating,"Dishoom is really superb, great food, great indoor décor (I especially like the design of female toilet) and great atmosphere. The service is also fast enough despite the fact that the restaurant is quite packed in lunch time. I would definitely recommend dishoom to my friends!"
26/10/2018,5 star rating,Prior to a visit to London I searched for Indian food and Dishoom seemed like the place to go. After walking around the city most of the day we headed to the restaurant only to find a long line at 8:00 PM. Disappointed we decided to return the following day at lunch. The food was excellent unlike so many of the Indian restaurants in the US each entree had a distinct and unique taste. Very fresh with a large array of choices. Highly recommend plan on arriving at 5:00 for dinner or make a reservation several days in advance.
1/12/2015,5 star rating,"Came here on a Sunday after a trip to Stonehenge and Bath at around 10PM and were seated right away downstairs. I actually loved the atmosphere downstairs and would have preferred to sit down there rather than upstairs. We ordered the lamb samosas, garlic naan, black house daal, and chicken ruby. Everything was SO delicious! My favorite was the black house daal though - it's vegetarian and they cook it for 24 hours so it's super flavorful. We also ordered drinks, which were pretty good too! The prices are totally reasonable so would totally come back for another meal if/when we come back to London!"
8/7/2015,4 star rating,"I'm definitely a fan of this haute Indian cuisine spot! The have the yummiest lassis, which you can opt to add a bit of vodka or whiskey to if desired. On a nice day, expect a line outside; as I approached Dishoom, I thought there was a day party going on - there were a bunch of fashionable Londoners on their phones waiting on line. Don't fret, it moves pretty quick."
27/10/2015,4 star rating,"The queues are out of the door, all the time, every day! There's a good reason for that. This place serves up a mean dish of British-Indian cuisine. I've taken friends from all over the world to the different Dishooms and it has never disappointed. We even showed up at 10 to 11pm and they were more than happy to get us seated and serve us, on top of letting us stay well into the hour! A tad pricey for Indian cuisine in London - but you get what you pay for. A must visit!"
15/7/2016,5 star rating,Everything we had was delicious. Well worth the hour and a half wait. The lamb biryani was great with the raita.
15/7/2013,4 star rating,"We really enjoyed Dishoom. The service was very fast, maybe a bit too hurried, but since we were going to a show in the West End, we didn't mind. Ordered the black Dahl, chicken tikka and butter naan and they were all excellent. I will warn the ""faint of spice"", the dishes are on the spicy side. Also ordered the Dishoom branded IPA and it was disappointing so don't go there. Lost a point to my taste because of too much butter on the butter naan (I know... What did I expect???), lamb appetizer was undistinguished and the service just a bit too over attentive. That said, Go Go Go!"
14/7/2018,4 star rating,Wonderful food. Upscale and not like traditional curry joints in London. Not an extensive menu but quality ingredients. A little pricey but normal for central London
14/10/2018,4 star rating,"Not traditional Indian Fare, but none the less, excellent food, tasty drinks and a happening scene.  Every dish we ate was excellent.  Most notable were the okra fries and then black dal.  The shrimp and breads were cooked perfectly."
25/2/2016,5 star rating,"Great Indian food! Would certainly visit again. Decided to drop by during the week around 1:30PM without a reservation. Showed up at the place and hostess informed me that a wait can be up to 50 minutes for 2 people. However if there's space at the bar, we can sit there first. The hostess was friendly and efficient and made you feel welcomed. So we waited about 20-30 minutes and we were able to get a table on the ground floor. We ordered the kebab, lamb chops, chicken curry, garlic naan, and rice to share. The wait staff was average, did their job and had no issues. The food were delicious and I would try other dishes the next time I visit! Would certainly visit again, however if I had to wait outside for 1+ hours in the cold, I wouldn't. Try to visit during non-peak hours."
24/4/2018,5 star rating,"Great food, great staff, great atmosphere. The portions are also larger than the server suggests so you can definitely order less than they say. I highly recommend the dal and any of the boxed street food items (like the street food bun appetizer - can't remember the name). The desserts are relatively average - go elsewhere for something stellar or just"
15/7/2015,5 star rating,"Best meal I had in London. Great service, great indian food, wonderful drinks. It is large so it wasn't a crazy wait."
6/10/2018,5 star rating,We loved this place. As good as Indian gets outside of India.
20/4/2018,5 star rating,"OUTSTANDING!!! There is a line down the street for a reason.  Food, service, ambiance are all wonderful. Reasonable prices, would be a repeat guest if I lived in the U.K."
1/7/2016,4 star rating,"Their brunch is amazing- just wish they offered it later in to the day, especially on weekends. Stopping before 12 is mad- should be available until 3/4pm. Otherwise a fab space with amazing food and drinks."
31/3/2013,4 star rating,"I've heard so much about Dishoom both on Yelp and through colleagues.  We finally organised a work dinner (score!) one night and I wasn't feeling too great but still dragged myself there.  I'm so glad I went even and fought through it.  Definitely worth it.  Now, the people I went to dinner with are Dishoom regulars and seemed to know what to order. They recommend having about 2 dishes per person.  It's like Indian tapas and it's meant to be shared.  We all threw out a few things from each and most of it was really good. Chili Cheese Toast - This was good but nothing too spectacular.   Keema Pau - This was good - order extra bread because what they give you isn't enough. Vada Pau - Much better than the Keema one!  Yum! Chicken Tikka - So good!  The seasoning was great and it was so juicy and tender. Paneer Tikka - This was good but would've preferred another order of the Chicken Tikka instead! Masala Prawns - Definitely one of the best dishes.  It packed a good spicy punch.   Lamb Biryani - This was good but nothing fantastic House Black Daal - Definitely the top dish for me.   I didn't see the bill but thinking you'd probably spend more here than your average place. The atmosphere is cool, not too uptight but nice and relaxed at the same time."
2/10/2016,3 star rating,"The queuing is unreal at the Kings Cross branch. It would make a lot of sense if they took bookings as the queue often engulfs the pavement and annoys the locals (incl me) by making them walk in the road. They have queue management staff but they are busy telling ppl it will be a 2hr wait and giving them tiny drinks to stop them from leaving. Other grumbles include excessive use of incense which can make you heave while eating, high prices, small portions and the strangeness that no one who works there seems to be asian (well, visible staff). That shouldn't make any difference but it kind of puts you off your food wondering if this is the only place in the world where indians are being served indian food by italians and poles. There is nothing wrong with that, its just so bizarre! Those aside, the food is really tasty. I've tried a lot of indian food here and in india and they have really nailed the recipes. I would probably be a regular it wasn't in such high demand."
9/12/2016,4 star rating,"Good Indian food, but a bit more expensive than other good Indian places in London, you pay the exrta for the great atmosphere! Good service but a long queue, luckily you van wait in their Bombay styled bar!"
30/9/2016,5 star rating,Food was amazing!!! The garlic chutney is the best I have ever had and the baileys chai was on point. Would definitely come here again.
26/12/2015,5 star rating,Addicted.  We went several times during our stay in London.  We're still talking about the daal and briyani.  We'll be back.
15/7/2017,5 star rating,"Hands-down, the BEST food we've ever had in London! We liked it so much that we went back 2 nights in a row. Here's our breakdown: SERVICE: SO great! We waited in line outside, about 45 minutes each night and both nights were impressed with the service. The hostess came around while we were in line outside with different drinks for all of us patiently waiting. We got mint tea, sherry, and chai tea. Everyone we interacted with was super nice and gave great recommendations for the food. The servers and hostesses just seemed very gracious in our waiting in line and were all very kind in demeanor. FOOD: Freakin' delicious! Actual flavor CAN be found in London! Here's what we tried over our 2 nights here: -Far Far: light and yummy snack chips that are fun and colorful and went great with the 3 sauces they bring to the table! -Chili Cheese Toast: a nice twist to regular toast with a little kick of spice mixed in with cheese. Very tasty! -Okra Fries: We had never tried okra and these were delicious all nice and fried -Pau Bhaji: tasty vegetable mash good to be swapped up with bread, but our least favorite dish. -Keema Pau: VERY good lamp/pea mashup also served with bread that comes so full of flavor your mouth is just in awe, but then you squirt some lemon on it and BOOM; you can't even believe it's better. -Murgh Malai: Super tender and flavorful chicken!! -Dishoom Chicken Tikka: another very tender and flavorful chicken in a happy mix of spices -Gunpowder Potatoes: good and a large amount we couldn't even finish it. Great white sauce that is served with them go well with pretty much anything else you order as well. -Spicy Lamb Chops: Very tender and delicious and accented marvelously by pomegranates. So good it almost tasted like beef! -Masala Prawns: Such delicious and plump shrimp in great flavor and comes even more to life with lime too. -Garlic Naan: Good solid naan; can't go wrong. -Dishoom Chocolate Pudding: Good but a little weird because it has chili in the chocolate but not terrible. I personally wouldn't order it again. Chocolate is very moist and rich. -Pistachio Kulfi: One of the best ice cream popsicles I've ever had. It's like super creamy condensed milk with a light pistachio flavor; perfect! All in all, come here and stuff your face. Will be our #1 spot to go to when in London!"
27/9/2016,5 star rating,"Best Indian food I've ever had! When we arrived at Dishoom and there was a line outside... they took our name and informed us that there would be about an hour wait. Since all the reviews raved about this place, we decided to wait it out. While outside they walked around serving Hot Chai Tea, Hot Green Tea, and Sherry Liquor. The line based very quickly (about 30 mins) and we were inside. The hostess invited us to the bar to wait for the remainder of our time and gave us a buzzard for when our table was ready. We had barely sat down with our beers before it went off (maybe 10 mins). The food was simply amazing! So authentic and full of spice! My boyfriend has a sensitive mouth when it comes to spicy food, but this was not the case. It was intense spice flavor without the burn you get from really spicy foods. The whole meal passed with flying colors. Not even halfway through our dinner we both agreed that we would come here again because it was defiantly worth the wait!!!"
20/6/2016,4 star rating,"Solid, though somewhat overly spiced, blend of modern and traditional Indian food.   We had chicken tikka and chicken biryani.  The waiter also brought us a black lentils dish.  All were good, if I had a any complaint is that the heat level is perhaps higher than it needs to be.  I like spicy, and enjoyed everything just fine.  But other diners at our table could barely eat their dishes. The decor is attractive and the Indian jazz fusion soundtrack was fun to listen to."
12/2/2013,2 star rating,"All flash no flavour. As other reviewers have mentioned, the way, even on a Thursday night, is about 45 minutes to an hour. While you are awaiting,  you can hang out at the bar downstairs where they have Indian inspired cocktails. My friend ordered the Boybam Pina Colada which was okay. It just tasted heavily of coconut milk and some 'Indian' spices. That being said, the atmosphere was lovely, the decor is very classy and the lighting makes for a great vibe. We ordered the samosas to start which were £4.00 a portion. Not. Worth. It. They are the packaged kind that you can get at any Sainsbury's or Tescos so avoid them if you can. The papadoms are delicious as is the naan bread. The curry is mediocre. Nothing you can't / won't get at a local Indian delivery place. In summation, go for the vibe but not the flavour."
14/12/2014,5 star rating,I'm a fan - it's basically Indian tapas. There was a long wait but when we were outside they brought us tea and let us wait at the bar once we got a buzzer. Good place to go with 3-4+ people. The ruby chicken and specialty lamb were great. Enjoyable dinner and cozy atmosphere.
16/6/2018,5 star rating,Absolutely delicious with excellent service and a lovely interior. We stayed for 3 hours and enjoyed every minute of it!
3/4/2018,4 star rating,I was disappointed - it didn't live up to the hype.  And it was pricier than I expected too. The black daal was very good.  The ruby chicken 3 stars.  It was tasty but I expected more. A small bowl of rice and plain nan were £2.90 each. I like doughy nan - this was crispy.  Maybe I'm just used to the cheap great tasting Indian food in Boston but this restaurant didn't live up to the high hype.  It is a good choice but not a crazy out of this world restaurant which many seem to indicate.  It's my first Indian restaurant in London in 20 years so I have to try a few more. If you come after 2 pm and before the dinner hour there should be no wait. They did tell me a 40 min wait but it was 5 min before we could go to the bar and another 10 or so minutes before I went to my table.
4/4/2015,5 star rating,this is my second experience at Dishoom and I am still in love. This is my first time at the central london locations as last time I went to the east london Dishoom. The food and service is great. I went at lunch time/ mid week so I didn't have to stand in line. I think when you stand in line for food you are often let down as you expect so much from standing in line. People who have had to stand in line to eat here may give this place less points. I do love this place and can't wait to try again. ps their house made kulfi is amazing! Cheese naan so tasty and very cheesy in a good way! yay for Dishoom! my favorite indian in London! although it is not traditional indian food it is one special place.
13/6/2018,5 star rating,Fantastic restaurant great food definitely worth the wait. The jack fruit biriyani is fantastic and the service is fast and polite. Expect to queue for about 40mins to get in  during busy periods but would recommend it.
23/10/2015,4 star rating,"Delicious, the restaurant was packed though, and the seating tight. The staff was exceptionally pleasant and the prices were on the expensive side of reasonable. I am very happy with my dining experience at Dishoom and would happily return."
4/5/2013,4 star rating,"Dishoom has an interesting concept that I have not seen in the US.  It's an Indian tapas restaurant with a specialty in grilled meats.  The entrees are meant to be shared. The restaurant has a nice clean casual ambiance on the first floor and a more intimate dining experience downstairs. We visited Dishoom on two different occasions and both visits were exceptional.  We tried the following: Lamb Boti Kebab, Spicy Lamb Chops, Chicken Malai, Chicken Tikka Roll, Seekh Kebab and Keema Pau.  Each dish has its own unique, distinct taste and made an excellent marriage between the food and wine. On our second visit, the owner selected our table for the ""Rules of the Matka"" which means if you roll the dice and get a 6 then they will cover your tab. So of course, the dice rolls and we leave with a wonderful meal on the house!   The owner and service staff were all great and made our last day in London memorable."
13/9/2018,4 star rating,"Amazing food and service flavours were perfect, however due to popularity waiting times were long, almost an hour to get a table, serving sizes also weren't huge, I ordered two mains just because I couldn't decide and I'm glad I did because I finished both plus dessert. Otherwise everything else was great"
12/9/2018,5 star rating,Absolutely incredible! The food here was amazing and the service was good. I would highly recommend to everyone.
22/9/2015,3 star rating,"I think this place is a little over-hyped.  I can't really fault the food - but it's not incredible, it's just a well honed menu that's cooked well...but it isn't ground breaking or any different to any other Indian restaurant around London really. I think it's mainly because this is a well decorated chain, that's the appeal.   We've had a few instances here where they haven't been able to adjust the menu even a little to suit our vegetarian friends - which is a shame as it wasn't difficult, then they kicked up a fuss about us, made us feel as though we were really demanding too much - so that's why I'm not giving it four stars."
7/9/2016,4 star rating,Fab for a date. Great cocktails with an Indian twist..solid varied menu with few weaknesses. Can be queues to get in at busy times but worth a little wait..
13/10/2013,4 star rating,"I visited Dishoom with my sisters. Try to make a reservation beforehand as this place is definitely popular. The decor makes you feel like you are in an early-1900's cafe in Bombay, so refreshing compared to other standard Indian restaurants. We ordered a range of things to share. I am a big fan of okra fries, house black dhaal, grilled paneer, and the masala prawns. The garlic naan is also a must. I was surprised to see that they did not have peshwari naan. The only dish that I wasn't impressed with was the vegetarian briyani. It was mediocre and had nothing special. The prices were extremely reasonable and my sisters and I agreed that this spot is really one of the best Indian spots we've been to in London."

8/11/2016,5 star rating,"Really enjoyed this meal! The restaurant is huge and frequently very busy. I was part of a group of 3 and we waited 30 minutes for a table on a Tuesday evening. Not unreasonable time to wait and it's easy enough to grab a drink at the bar or sit on the patio out front. Servers are friendly and attentive, especially considering how busy the restaurant is. Food delivered promptly and drinks didn't stay empty for long. The menu is very extensive and works really well if you get a few dishes to share as a group. Drinks on offer are great particularly the cocktails. This place is great for small parties aswell as bigger groups of friends, workers or families. I highly recommend the lamb chops as they were delicious, though portion size is quite small if you were to share. Definitely would come back to this place."
9/11/2014,4 star rating,"Fantastic service. Fantastic food. Ambience was great, busy, warm, buzzing! Hosts were lovely, managed to squeeze in a table for two. Our waiter was amazing also, I actually think it was his first shift too and we had no idea! He absolutely made our experience and we told the manager as such. The food is pretty delicious, however slightly expensive and the chilli chocolate mousse did not taste like there was any chilli and the fresh mint tea had no hot water in the pot (oops!). We did not expect the black dahl to be creamy (my friend is lactose intolerant, however we didn't tell them this was our faults). Otherwise an amazing time, would highly recommend with some good friends or friends that are happy to share dishes (that is the main idea), definitely a good business dinner place or for a date (you can definitely hear yourself talk). It feels electric!"
31/8/2016,5 star rating,"We visited yesterday and had a thoroughly lovely time. The service was super quick, the menu was modern and the food was delicious! The staff I have to say were outstanding. We were served by a petite blonde lady downstairs. She was extremely kind and efficient. She was also great with our children. The air con downstairs made it the place to be and it helped with the chicken tikka! We sampled both the tikka and a suggestion from Dipak who was great with a pre-dining enquiry we had. I have to say that I really liked receiving emails from Dipak and I can 100% say that he loves his job and is definitely an extra mile kind of employee. If he knows anything about digital marketing/affiliate marketing.. Get in touch!   I digress, the  Murgh Malia, tikka along with curries, breads and rice were  all expertly cooked and beautifully presented! Thank you for a thoroughly enjoyable experience from the point of booking to finish. Ps - customers - we had booked and were seated immediately but please don't think that you can simply get a table at busy times... BOOK. This place gets very busy from 5pm onwards and you can be waiting for up to 1.5 hrs. They do give you drinks whilst you wait outside in a queue as the bar gets busy and is small. We thought the drinks were a  pretty cool way of appreciating people who were queueing outside."
27/5/2018,5 star rating,"Amazing Indian food, great atmosphere. The prices are also reasonable, especially by London standards"
27/5/2018,4 star rating,"Daal was phenomenal. Probably the best daal I have had. Food was heavy, but yet very good. I enjoyed my experience very much so."
25/11/2013,4 star rating,"Had dinner here last night and I fell in love with the curry, as well as the okra chips.  The staff was very nice and the food was great, though I've had better naan at other locations.  Then naan was good, though it was a tad too crispy for my own taste as I prefer it fluffier, but that's no deal breaker.  They also had Kingfisher beer, which is easily the best Indian beer around. The place is small and dark but has a nice atmosphere and if you have to wait to be seated, you'll get hooked up with spiked chai which definitely makes the wait a lot more pleasant. I would certainly put Dishoom down on my list of places to check out if looking for Indian food while in London."
24/5/2016,5 star rating,"A beautiful restaurant. Very clean. The staff and Managment is extremely knowledgable of their food and menu. The best Chicken Tikka Masala ""Chicken Ruby"" I've ever had. And the Pistachio Kulfi is a wonderful dessert. A very clean restroom. Oh and they play traditional Indian music"
24/8/2016,5 star rating,"Both the food and service were outstanding. We had tikka masala fans visiting, and they loved the chicken ruby. To avoid the lines make a booking on the website, just make sure it is done 24hrs in advance."
20/5/2018,5 star rating,"The food was absolutely amazing and worth the 30 minute wait. I was told during peak hours, it can get up to 2 hours. It is a great fusion mix of Indian and Iranian. The food is fresh and comes out quickly. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. If I had more time, I would go again and again. Would love to try their full menu!!!"
17/5/2016,3 star rating,"It was good but honestly I am just as down with Punjab, where you can make a reservation and NOT wait in line for 45 minutes."
15/5/2013,5 star rating,"Damn, wish we had an Indian restaurant like this in Los Angeles. Our group ordered all the vegetarian items on the menu. We had to order more food after the first round, it was that good! Check this place out, I've never been to an Indian restaurant like Dishoom. The atmosphere is great too! Get the ""Thums Up"", an original Indian cola, to wash it all down. Yummmm. ""Thums Up, Taste the Thunder"""
12/5/2016,5 star rating,"Honestly my experiences with Indian food is limited, but the place really sets the standards enormously high; although it's hard to actually have a conversation in one of the most busy restaurants in London, it doesn't even matter because the food is so delicious that you simply forget to converse. I've been there twice and will be coming back every time I travel to London, and will recommend every friend I've got to do the same exactly thing!"
11/8/2010,3 star rating,"Hmmm... well there were certainly loads of pros to Dishoom, mainly the delicious, spicy, fresh, and utterly fantastic food. But outside of the steaming hot plates of goodness that came quickly and seemingly endlessly, I wasn't overly impressed. Sure, with a sterile atmosphere like this you have the benefit of not reeking of curry when you leave. Your eyes won't burn, you won't be pushed around by storm trooper servers, and you won't feel rushed out of your seat by the next group of people who have been standing over you drooling for over an hour... (You *know* who I'm talking about.) Consequently though, you'll feel like you're eating Indian food in veritable Cheesecake Factory atmosphere. The whole urban industrial feel just didn't correspond with the cuisine. The service also seemed a bit off. Our group of 12 was split over two four-person booths, as apparently they don't take bookings. (In fact, we were probably lucky to get a table for all of us, full stop.) Our table never received water though we asked multiple times. A few lassies went missing. Though we ordered two of everything, the orders seemed to be confused over the two tables. I can't fault the delicious food -- it really was stunning. But the rest of the experience didn't dishoooooom me away."
21/5/2015,3 star rating,"This was my second time eating at Dishoom, and I must say I was not as impressed as I was the first time. Their signature chicken curry dish is absolutely amazing, I have go give them that, but I found their other dishes subpar. My boyfriend ordered a paneer curry dish that lacked in flavor and spice, was not even comparable to the taste of the chicken curry that I ordered. Wait is often incredibly long, and it is crowded and loud in the restaurant. Maybe I just went on an off day this time, but I was not as impressed with it and believe that there are other more authentic indian restaurants with less wait and hype in the area."
24/2/2018,2 star rating,"Honestly can't see what the fuss is about. Guess it found its niche. Food bland, not enough spices.. Maybe they are not going for my palate. Massive queues and overrated."
7/5/2018,5 star rating,Best dal anywhere. Love the paneer tikka. Never disappoints! Wish they would come to NY!
29/8/2013,5 star rating,"Excellent Indian food in a trendy Bollywood setting.  We walked in without a booking and were lucky to be seated right away.  The waiter had good explanations of the dishes, which came out incredibly fast. It may not be the most authentic Indian food, but it was delicious and the environment was lively and fun.  Good place for families too."
5/5/2016,4 star rating,"Great food, slow service, and overpriced for the small portions. I would go back there just for the quality and taste!"
6/8/2018,4 star rating,Good Indian food. Nice cocktails. True they always have a long waiting which kind of is putting of. I wish they would take table reservations
16/1/2015,4 star rating,"The food was good, it wasn't amazing but it's definitely better than most indian restaurants. The true standout element for Dishoom is it's silver screen old bollywood ambience. Everything from the little mint tea and chai glasses served to the people waiting in line to get into the restaurant to the decor in the restrooms was perfectly coordinated for a fantastic, entertaining experience."
4/8/2016,5 star rating,"This is among the cheaper restaurants in London, but don't let the price fool you. They could easily add 5 pound to each item and there wouldn't be any fewer customers. I ordered what Yelp recommended and was amazed at how much high quality food I got for the price. At the end is the day, my mum and I were full, very happy, and only 40 pound poorer."
4/8/2016,4 star rating,"Loved the food and restaurant. However there was several stages of waiting- we had to queue outside for 20 min, then go to the bar and queue again afterwards finally got shown to our table. Staff are super friendly and food arrived on time."
19/6/2013,5 star rating,"Now I know why the national dish of England may be Chicken Tikka Masala. After asking the waiter, what is good here?"" He replied, everything on the menu. If you order something and it is not to your liking, I will buy you and your friends a round of drinks. Needless to say, we bought all of our own drinks that night. Highlights include Lamb Raan, Calimari, and Garlic Naan. Trendy, chic, and a smorgasbord of radness"
19/8/2010,4 star rating,"In Manchester we often forget there are other cities in the country capable of producing excellent Indian food. We swan around like we're Lord of the Manor, thinking our curries of the mile are as authentic and mindblowing as pizza in New York, burritos in San Francisco, Scouse in Liverpool. Hey. Scouse is important. It's a culinary behemoth! Anyway, sometimes we really need taking down a peg or two, and Dishoom really knocked me into shape. First of all, it was different. All clean, shiny surfaces; metallic minimalism... you couldn't call it traditional if you tried, certainly a far cry from the linen tablecloths and chintzy decor I'm used to in Rusholme. Then, the dishes, and I have to tell you - this is the way to eat Indian food. Forget getting your own specific dish, you want a multitude of plates in the middle of the table and you want to mix and match. Tapas-style sharing is what I like best when it comes to dining, and this was perfect. It's not for the faint of tastebud, as some of the dishes pack a punch - the samosas are spicy, the utterly scrumptious fish fingers are tingly, but there's plenty of raita to cool things down and if that's not enough, soothe your senses with a lassi... rum optional, wink. The paneer salad is all kinds of lush and Lizzie is so right about that Pau Bhaji, very simple but effective? Mightily so. I was one of her very happy campers that evening and I can attest to the fact that we heartily ploughed our way through this divine dish. They even do breakfasts with an Indian twist, with lots of delicious spiced pastries, and I'd walk back to London if it meant sampling that delicious-sounding chai hot chocolate. This is definitely a place to take somebody to impress, and I'll certainly be recommending it to my London friends. I'll also be warning them that they don't take reservations, so my tip is to get there nice and early!"
16/10/2012,4 star rating,"Dishoom is best known for their Indian cuisine, but the star of the show for me was their Thums Up Flip.  The best description of this cocktail can be found directly on Dishoom's website:  dishoom.com/2012/05/clas…. (Yes, I'm aware of the laziness inherent to my decision NOT to describe the cocktail) As for the cuisine, this is a refreshing departure from curries loaded in oils and fat or rice dishes buried in a pile of butter.  Rather, you will find a celebration of grilled meats spiced to perfection, proper preparations of biryani loaded with flavor from spices and your accompanying meat of choice, and delightfully soft naan (the one area where I do enjoy a rather unhealthy coat of butter).   Overall, I think Dishoom served some solid cuisine in a chic space and adds welcoming dashes of great service and splendid drinks.  I'd go back if I was in the area."
8/9/2015,5 star rating,Amazing food.  I went back to London recently for vacation and was so jet-lagged I actually made it for breakfast!  The Bombay Omelette or the Akuri are seriously to do by...
1/10/2013,5 star rating,"This was our last dinner in London and we definitely ended with a fantastic meal. After hearing that I MUST try the Indian food in London, I thought Dishoom would be my best bet. It totally was. There was a wait when we arrived around 8 pm but we were seated within 30 minutes or so. I wanna say the menu is set up kinda like a tapas style..which can make it expensive. We ordered a pitcher of Bombay Pimm's to start and it was delicious! We ordered some naan and veggie samosas for apps, definitely recommend both. I ordered the chicken tikka and devoured each bite, especially with that fabulous yogurt sauce. I wish it was in the states so I could enjoy it whenever I wanted!"
26/11/2014,5 star rating,"this was me and Justin B's first meal on our London vacay and we definitely got our trip off to a great start by having dinner at Dishoom! it's located right in the middle of all the convent garden shops and restaurants. we showed up early at like 530pm on a friday night and there was already a queue for an hour wait! we figured that this place had to be good so we waited outside patiently as a queue formed behind us. they have such an organized line system - first wait outside, then sit inside as waiting areas open up, then transition downstairs to the bar as space opens up there so an hour wait isn't that painful. we ordered a couple of cocktails and a calamari appetizer in the bar area to wet our appetite and then we were seated for dinner in the downstairs dining room. everything on the dinner menu sounded so good so we ordered a little bit of everything haha. the dishoom chicken tikka was so good and the meat had such a nice grilled flavor to it! the chicken ruby curry was super flavorful and rich! the only miss for me was the kacchi lamb biryani only b/c it was a bit too spicy for me...and the black house daal (lentils) was probably my favorite dish of the night! of course we ordered garlic naan to sop up all the extra sauce for the dishes too. sooo much food but it was soo good! probably the best Indian food that i've ever had. this place definitely isnt cheap since all the dishes add up fast, but its worth the splurge!"
31/7/2013,5 star rating,"I loved it. So my sister and I went for black dhal, soft shell crab, chicken tikka, salad and dessert. Black dhal was just soooo amazing - it's a must if you're here - it's very slowly cooked (I think they say something about 24 hours...) Soft shell crab in a curry sauce was nice though a bit too salty - with some roti it went well. Chicken tikka was succulent, fresh and juicy - definitely worth a try. And dessert (chocolate mousse) was heavenly. Thing is - you mix it with the frozen yogurt yourself and a yogurt is so much healthier than heavy cream! We left the place satisfied, but not disgustingly full when you down heaps of oily curries and thick naan - but more like 'happy inside' and feeling good about ourselves. The atmosphere in this place is quite cool - sort of old school bollywood meets urban. It has dimmed light and nice music. Perfect! The service was good and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place and would definitely come back!"
3/7/2011,4 star rating,"Great Location, great food, great staff. Finally had a Thumbs up after a good 15 years! I was in heaven...not that I care for Thumbs up..but it was a part of my childhood and was thrilled to see it, in a glass bottle that too!! Ate here on 2 occasions, the first time was lunch got the Rumali roti and Chicken tikka. Hubby got the Chicken Berry Biryani...I can't wait to go to Bombay and try the berry pulav at Britannia so I can compare! Second time round went with a couple of friends we ordered up a storm. Pau Bhaji, Spicy roasted potatoes,Lamb Chops, Sausages and Lamb Biryani. Dessert was excellent, we got the Gola ice( which was forbidden to us as kids growing up in India) It was pretty good as was the berry crumble ( not very Indian I know...but so good). I got a Limca this time!! Definitely a good spot to eat some good Indian food, a little expensive but oh so worth it! Looking forward to going back this September with my sisters!"
29/7/2018,4 star rating,"Food was great, atmosphere was great. The line was too long. We went after work, 6-10 PM ordeal. It's good but not that good to have to wait 2.5 hours to get seated. Staff is also incredibly nice."
28/9/2015,4 star rating,"Although a bit too polished for my taste, Dishoom's take on Indian dishes and its vibrant atmosphere make it worth a visit. Get their brunch omelette!"
24/4/2016,5 star rating,Amazing but be prepared to stand in line for over an hour. Get the chicken ruby. You won't regret it.
31/3/2013,4 star rating,"My experience was very similar to that of the other reviewers. The food at Dishoom is great, but the servers are pushy and inattentive."
10/10/2011,4 star rating,"I love small plates and I love Indian food - so Dishoom is pretty much perfect for me. The service is pretty good, especially since they seem to pump tables through pretty quickly. The cocktail menu is short, but thoughtful. Every drink has a Bombay twist. I would recommend the Bombay Colada. It's smoother, lighter and much more complex in flavour than a regular pina colada. My two favourite dishes are the Murgh Chicken (grilled chicken thigh) and the Black Daal - both are to die for. I'm not usually a chicken thigh kind of gal, but I'd choose this thigh over a piece of chicken breast any day. Although the Chilli Cheese Toast came highly recommended, I didn't think it was much more than plain old cheese on toast with a few chillies... something I can do myself at home. And of course you must not leave without trying one of the Kulfi Sticks. Great stuff."
18/7/2018,5 star rating,"Had an amazing meal at Dishoom! Wonderful flavors and many dishes that were not too spicy - our 12 year old really enjoyed! We had the Veggie somosas, chicken tikka, ruby chicken, biriyani and daal.  Drink menu was extensive and interesting!  Would definitely come back again!"
13/4/2018,5 star rating,"We had a wonderful late lunch at Dishoom!  They went above and beyond to accommodate our food allergies (dairy, tree nuts and sesame).  Prior to arriving, the manager communicated our allergies to the chef.  The chef specially prepared food in a separate area to avoid any cross contamination.  The server went over the menu with us letting us know which items would be best suitable to our needs and took all the precautions necessary.  Our food arrived with allergy sticks as well.  Our children really enjoyed the food.  Thank you Dishoom for your efforts to make this a stress free experience for our family.  We will be back again!"
10/7/2016,4 star rating,"Delish food. The black dhaal is to die for as is the lamb. Still not sure if I would do the queue thing, you can book for parties of 6 or more."
9/9/2015,5 star rating,"I've been to India, and know clearly the difference between Indian food, as made over here, and over there. I can clearly say that Dishoom is the best indian I've tasted in the UK, hands down. Really, clear, crisp flavours, and some delicious combinations (plus being just down the road from my office) mean this is a place I'll be coming back to again and again."
5/7/2018,5 star rating,Excellent curry! Exactly what we needed for making up for the bad british foodwe had been eating!
1/10/2015,4 star rating,"Dishoom is a great place to enjoy a night.  Now we did have to wait an hour until we were seated for dinner, but we did have chai tea to warm us up while waiting outside.  Get here early, or your wait will be longer. This is not a fancy place, but the food is great.  Gunpowder potatoes, with black daal.  Ruby chicken, spicy lamb, fresh flat bread.  Spicy shrimp was great. The food was better than Quilon, which has a Michelin star for fancy food."
18/2/2011,5 star rating,"SO many people recommended this place to me, I was seriously excited to finally go there for breakfast last week. An odd choice? Indian breakfast? Oh no, no. At 8.30am the place was practically empty, but with beautiful big windows and a loads of light, it was inviting from the word go. I started with black coffee and freshly squeezed OJ, complimented with a side of bacon naan roll. The naan, freshly made on site, housed beautiful smoked backed bacon and was served with homemade chili jam. Good lord. It was divine. The combination just worked and the portion was just enough to leave me full. None of the greasy, 'what have I just eaten' guilt you normally get when you eat something hot for breakfast. I'm taking a friend back in a few weeks to have EXACTLY the same thing, and will be trying to do lunch or dinner asap. I hear the curry is die to for."
20/9/2010,4 star rating,"I'm not sure what to say....... Ok so first off i must offer my sincerest apologies to all the Indian restaurants in Glasgow....'I'm sorry darling, i have strayed.....I have slipped off my wedding ring and fallen into the tasty, tasty, naan bread bed of another....'....yeah. So, Dishoon ya bam! Apart from sounding like a village on the east coast of Scotland (try saying it in your very best Sean Connery accent....see!!), Dishoon is a rather upmarket, trendified Indian serving tapas style dishes of amazing quality and fantastic taste. A number of us piled in here for some grub after an arduous day of arse-sitting-on and brain filling-upped-ness....very tiring don't you know! To be treated to some rather fookin tasty grub, ranging from old favorites to some pretty unique dishes (all amazing). Being a large group we were spread out over two booths, a bit of a tight fit but good for group bonding..... Dishes were brought at a steady pace, drinks were kept a flowing and service in general was prompt, polite and well...good. Price?? Well, ok its maybe a bit on the high end, but given the area and the quality of the food, then its little wonder its a tad n the high end. Verdict then? Great grub, great service and a great way to have a culinary affair on the city you love.....Look out for Jeremy Kyle: He cheated on me with anther city...Glasgow spills Chris's sordid culinary secrets...booo, hiss!!!!"
9/11/2015,4 star rating,"Great cocktails and food! A friend queued on my behalf so when I got there I got to slip right in, which probably helped my general experience here. Not sure I would bother queuing myself..."
2/9/2012,4 star rating,"I came into today for lunch needing to get some Indian food on this short trip to London. A couple quick notes: (1) I've never been to Bombay & have no real idea what a Bombay Café is, but I do know Dishoom had a great vibe/atmosphere going (2) When it comes to Indian food I'm one of those, ""let's try the tikka masala"" people. Sad but true. Sitting down, my server was patient with me and made some great recommendations: - Sheekh Lamb - really enjoyed this - Dhaba Chicken - nothing I would have ever ordered, but I was glad he threw the special at me - very good - Naan - only negative was the Naan wasn't warm when it got to me, but they did have a couple 12 tops clogging things up. Ultimately, this is 3.5 restaurant, but the service rounded it up for me. Worth coming in if you're in the neighborhood. Not sure I'd make a special trip to come here."
26/6/2018,5 star rating,"Great!! We had to wait for about 30 minutes for our seat but it was very pleasant. We were given the WiFi network and lemonade while we waited in line and then were taken down to the bar area for the remainder of the wait. The Chicken Ruby was amazing, basically tiki masala and we even ordered the Dishoom Chocolate Pudding for dessert which was also great. The staff were extremely nice and I  totally recommend this restaurant... great experience."
26/6/2018,5 star rating,Well worth the wait!!!! The food was delicious and the service was of the utmost quality!! Would recommend to anyone looking for good Indian food while in london!
16/9/2016,4 star rating,Yes I like this place. The staff is very friendly and the food is good. Good prices as well - I had the lamb and it was delicious. If possible try going during the week - I've been there during the weekend and it is extremely hard to get table.
17/6/2018,5 star rating,"Great drinks and food. I love the chicken rubby and the garlic roti. Except to wait a while and have a difficult time getting a reservation, but once you are seated it is great. Don't let them seat you in the living room area. The food is really great."
14/1/2015,5 star rating,"Whenever I'm in London, I come to Dishoom every time with a friend. Next time, I'll go again with a friend. It's my go to place for breakfast."
16/6/2018,5 star rating,"This was my boyfriend and I's favorite meal during our stay in London. We arrived at 11:30 and were able to order the bacon naan (amazing) off the breakfast menu, followed by several items off the lunch menu, which begins at noon. Our favorite was the chicken ruby. Make sure you order a side of basmati rice as a base. The service was very good!"
16/6/2018,5 star rating,"Me and my partner when there for dinner, service was excellent and the food was amazing! It is however more expensive than other Indian restaurants in the area"
2/1/2013,4 star rating,"I have always heard that the one cuisine that the UK has got on lock is Indian, and I was not disappointed.  I was meeting up with a fine Irishman that I know from NYC for dinner and he suggested we come here.  Points for him because everything was awesome - from the food down to the service.  We didn't make a reservation and it was quite crowded at 7pm so we sat down by the bar and had a drink while waiting for a table to open up.  The hostess told us it would be an hour wait, but ended up being about 20 minutes, really. Food is served tapas style, but don't let that fool you into thinking you will need to order loads of food.  The dishes are deceivingly filliung.  We ordered some veggie samosas, naan and then two entrees and were quite content.  I found everything I tried to be very flavorful with the perfect amount of heat (I like my food spicy).  I would definitely eat here again!"
14/6/2016,5 star rating,"Delicious, authentic Indian food. Highly recommend the breakfast menu, as well as the chocolate cake and chilli ice cream for dessert if that's available. Expect a wait, although some of their locations do take reservations!"
23/10/2017,5 star rating,OMG!!! Visiting London from California with my mom. Selected this restaurant because of the yelp reviews. I can sum up this restaurant in one word: fantastic. Each and every bite was superb!! Mother is a very critical restaurant goer and she absolutely loved the food here. We started with vegetable samosas and then ordered the chef special prawn curry and grilled lamb chops and sautéed vegetables and garlic naan and a carafe of wine and we have a perfect meal. everything was seasoned well. We LOVED every morsel and didn't want dinner to end. I told my mom that I would consider staying an extra day in London just so I could eat here again!!!
7/9/2017,5 star rating,Great Indian fusion restaurant. All their circled items are awesome and very tasty. The service is also great.
7/9/2015,5 star rating,"Holy cow! Everything was amazing, delicious and bursting with flavor. The lamb samosas were tasty, the calamari got better with each bite, the garlic naan was delicious and the  chicken ruby was succulent and to die for. Our waitress, Maisse? Was so friendly, attentive and spot on with her suggestions.  I will be recommending this place to everybody I know."
11/8/2015,4 star rating,Must order the Black Daal! It goes great as a side with any entree and is absolutely incredible. Attentive service and nice atmosphere. Outside seating is very nice as well. Food is superb!
29/2/2012,3 star rating,"An Indian fry up? In theory, bacon in naan bread smothered in chutney should have you telling your usual bacon butties to move over, dhal-ing. In practise, it could do with a bit more tandoor oven care. My breakfast didn't blow me away. So when I'm nursing a hangover, I'll pass on Dishoom. Meet me down in the British caf. And pass the brown sauce."
15/7/2013,4 star rating,"Really good: chicken berry Britannia, masala prawns, Murgh malai. Good: spicy lamp chop, kingfisher. Ok: house black daal, bhang lassi. Can be better(good taste, but its not warm/crispy enough; seems was pre-cooked and put there for a while): Lamb samosas. Good service"
3/6/2016,5 star rating,"Amazing ambience, upbeat decor and they give free drinks / chai in the line! Amazing experience and food is pretty amazing too."
3/6/2016,5 star rating,One of my favourite restaurants in the area. It feels like you're in an expensive restaurant but it's actually quite affordable. The food is delicious and the decor is really cool. I particularly like the outside seating area.
30/8/2015,5 star rating,"Yum Yum YUM! I ordered the grilled paneer with bell peppers, garlic naan, and mango lassi. Everything was perfect. A little more expensive than my typical travel budget, but honestly so worth it. Great Indian food can be quite hard to find in the US, so I was really impressed with Dishoom."
2/1/2012,3 star rating,Dishoom is mentioned in the Time Out tour guide. I was quite disappointed to try the Bomba[y] Omelette. What is special about it? It tasted like a simple omelette to me. It was cool to learn about the tradition of Bombay Cafes in London from the history lesson on the menu.
1/6/2013,4 star rating,"The place is mobbed, not surprising given the Covent Garden location and inside it's working at full tilt with a slightly frenetic atmosphere. The food is Indian Street food but with West End London prices but quite reasonable really and pretty straightforward. Definitely Indian rather than the more Bangladeshi style that is quite common in London (both are good in my book). We could only get a 6pm table and already the place was packed . It's a bit of a production line but we were seated right away and service was quick and efficient. Drinks came quickly. We ordered our food (being told that everything would come as soon as it was ready) and it all arrived within about 10 minutes. I like the design with the vintage Indian posters dotted around and the low lighting. Josh sticks mixed with spices as the aroma that hits you when you enter. The Bhel (isn't this normally called Bhelpuri?) delicious snack food of crispy rice, herbs and spices which came first was great. We also sampled the Okra fries and calamari. Both pretty good, fairly standard calamari. The lamb biryani was good but not the best I have had (a bit one dimensional and I prefer versions with super tender lamb) but the murgh malai (marinated chicken thighs) was great. The house black daal (signature dish) was rich and creamy. Naan bread was average. So very enjoyable meal overall, we didn't make it to deserts being pretty full at this point. Overall 4 stars for the food, service, ambience and pricing combination."
30/4/2012,4 star rating,Definitely would go back. Food was great and while the service started out slow (took a bit to place our order which caused some stress given we had theatre tickets) once we placed the order the food came fast. The chili potatoes (or something like that) and naan were my favorites. Also the squid starter. But there wasn't a bad thing we had. Great location for theatre tickets as well. They don't take reservations for small parties but we had no problem getting a table about 6:00pm on a weeknight prior to the theatre.
30/5/2016,3 star rating,"We went to the restuarant in Covent Garden.  The wait was approx 2hrs.  They had no booking system and had to stand in the line for most of this time.   The ambience was good, the staff were friendly, but the food was average at best. We ordered all the signature dishes: Pau Bhaji, Prawn Moilee, and Black House Daal. For dessert we ordered the Dishoom Chocolate Pudding. This tasted aweful.   All in all, I wont be heading there again any time soon."
5/8/2018,5 star rating,Just arrived in London and a friend recommended this to me. Drool so delish. Fast service. The wait staff is super friendly and would stop by to engage in convo. You could tell it was a great place to work. Good vibes and authentic family owned restaurant. They had a handicap restroom
14/4/2012,5 star rating,"I probably would have given this place 4* on the food and service alone.   Why the extra star?  Well, when I asked the waiter what foods I could eat given my dairy intolerance, his reply was ""let me get the 'dairy-free' menu for you."" Amazing.  I've never been to a restaurant where they already have a dairy-free menu prepared.  The food which could be altered were starred and the food that couldn't were highlighted.   The food itself was pretty good.  I'm not usually one for eating at places which serve Indian-type food, as my parents cook some of the best curries.  Ever.  I have to say if they ever go on holiday and I'm craving some Indian food, this is where I'm coming.   Oh, and did I mention how delicious the cocktails were?!  I had the BollyBellini and Chilli Martini.  So so good. Definitely coming back here soon."
17/5/2011,4 star rating,"We had a team dinner at Dishoom for our office.  I was expecting a run-of-the-mill Indian restaurant - and was completely caught off guard. The food at Dishoom was very nicely prepared, very fresh flavours, nice spices, and served piping hot!  The atmosphere was also very clean and trendy.  Amazingly, with the 17 guests that we had in our party, the service was very good and the food/wine continued to flow nicely.  They handled a large party very well and the service was good quality. Dishoom is probably a bit on the pricey side for Indian-fare, but this place is well worth it.  This is a great find in Leicester Square and I highly recommend!"
24/5/2016,4 star rating,"I was impressed with Dishoom, not only for the delicious food but the ambiance of the restaurant and the way it made me feel I was in India, not in kings cross."
21/5/2016,5 star rating,"I had high expectations for Dishoom, I'd somehow left it a couple of years before visiting but after everyone I knew had raved about it I figured it was probably time to relent. I was not disappointed, the decor was beautiful but more importantly for me the staff were perfect.Knowledgable, attentive and seemed to perfectly pitch their service to each individual table. One of our friends was late but we were given (delicious) free chai lattes until she arrived. The dishes were beautifully seasoned, full of exciting, daring flavours and completed beautifully by the drinks menu. I was working after our visit and was delighted to find a soft drink menu that had been as carefully thought through as the alcohol - rare to say the least. I spent a few months in India and this is by far the closest I've got to eating the amazing things I discovered there in England. Do it."
12/3/2015,4 star rating,"This place is amazing! I've heard mixed reviews from other people but my experience was one of the best I've had eating out in London for months. We went on a Monday so had no problem being seated, Wednesday and onward is bound to be more hellish. They don't take bookings for tables under 6 people, so if you're a small party you might have to wait but the place is huge. The food is served almost like an Indian version of tapas. The waiter will guide you and tell you how many dishes would feed your party. Don't be fooled, you will be coaxed into ordering more food but there's a lot of amazing dishes that you'll want to try. As a vegetarian I felt like I had plenty to choose from, and the food came out fast and tasted amazing. The staff are lovely and patient, but this might be different on a busier night (I hope not). The cocktails are delicious and not too over-priced. All-in-all, this place is worth a visit. Go!"
19/7/2013,5 star rating,"Great central location. Attentive service. Delicious no frills indian food. Cant go wrong and very reasonably priced. If you are in central london and are craving kebabs, hit this spot. it hits the spot."
28/9/2015,5 star rating,"My husband and I aren't big fans of Indian but decided we had to go to at least one Indian restaurant while in London and Dishroom did not disappoint! We ordered the Chicken Ruby, lamb rice pilaf (can't remember the proper name), garlic naan, Black Daal, & raita all of which were fabulous! There will wait if you go during normal dinner hours but ours wasn't nearly as long as they told us it would be and we got complimentary mint and chai tea."
30/11/2015,5 star rating,Great food and ambiance.  The place is packed - busy and yummy.  You should share dishes. I didn't mind waiting 30 minutes outside in the cold -  I'll be back!
1/8/2010,5 star rating,"Every time I'm in London I want Fish and Chips and Indian food. I know, I know. How very American of me. My boyfriend and I shared a bunch of food at  Dishoom tonight -veggie samosas, chili cheese toast, daal, naan, lamb chops and chicken tikka. I like the small plates, it gives you a chance to try different things without getting too stuffed. My only complaint was that the naan was a bit dry/burnt. Everything else was SUPER tasty, flavorful and fresh. The staff was on top of things and didn't blink when we asked for more water and daal during the meal. Big thanks to whomever on here recommended trying the cocktails. I had the Bombalda (pineapple, coconut milk, rum and spices) which was some fantastic Indian-esque take on a Pina Colada. Super tasty. My boyfriend had the Chaijito, which had chai-infused rum in it, he confessed it was ""basically just a mojito"" but still tasty."
25/2/2011,2 star rating,"Had an OK experience here. Went in a group of six on a Thursday night with a reservation; good thing, too, because the place was packed. We sat in the basement/""bottom floor"" in a kind of alcove. We wanted to get grilled vegetables and fried calamari as starters, but the waiter said these items (which ARE labeled as ""starters"" in the menu) come out with all the other entrees. This system didn't really bother me but I just found it odd. For my main I got the murgh malai chicken. It was alright. I tried some sauces on my chicken; this was a bad move. Some of these table sauces were damn spicy. Not a refreshing, nasal-pasage-clearing spicy, just a prickly, why-is-this-sauce-like-this? unnecessary spicy. That kind of ruined the meal for me. The grilled veggies and calamari were fine but nothing to rave about. Everyone else seemed to like their dishes but nobody was like, ""Oh, man, this is so good, you've gotta try some!"" The server was fine but there were times I wished he availed himself to our table a bit more tenaciously. Prices are quite good, all main dishes under or around GBP 10. The decor and ambience were very nice, lots of Indian ephemera and dim lighting. I should note the gents' bathroom: it has huge urinals and an odd soap dispenser. Overall a slightly below average experience. I can see that most people really like this place so I would give it another shot, but if I'm picking out a restaurant this wouldn't be my top pick. Be your own judge, however, because sooner or later you're gonna have to stop listening to me and start making your own choices. And that soap dispenser was pretty weird, so maybe go just to check it out."
14/5/2016,4 star rating,"Always love this place. The only thing that lets it down is the no-booking policy. It's clearly a way of getting more people I and out over a period of an evening, but to the detriment of the diners."
6/8/2017,5 star rating,"Food was good and service was excellent.  This place is always packed, we were able to get in for late lunch."
10/5/2016,3 star rating,"Great indian/pakistani food but slightly pricey (especially the naans). There are better, tastier, and cheaper options like Tayyabs and Lahore Kebab House."
27/5/2013,5 star rating,"This is the place that I ever had biryani.  And it was delicious and the stuff in the US will not likely ever live up to it (I'm trying and I'm kinda sad about ruining it for myself by having it in London before the US)!  The chai was also very strong and delicious.  Look for the colorful bicycles outside for the restaurant.   There was a breakfast menu that was separate from the lunch menu.  So definitely be sure of the timing since there are two separate menus (we had lunch).   It's walkable from tralfagar, for the tourists."
19/7/2012,4 star rating,"In the past month, I've eaten at Dishoom three times.  The food has been outstanding.  During my first visit, phaldari kofta ruby was the special.  It was one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.  During my second visit, I was with a group of eight people.  Amongst us, we had virtually everything on the menu.  We enjoyed it all.  Of particular note, we positively devoured the lamb biryani, fried okra, and black dahl.  Additionally, on the whole, the staff is friendly and attentive.   One caveat regarding service: I found that the waitstaff tended to underestimate the amount of food that came with each order, often suggesting that each person get more than one dish.  While the food is certainly tasty enough to warrant getting a sampling, I've found that the lamb biryani and two pieces of nan is enough for two satisfying meals."
24/7/2010,4 star rating,"I heard about this opening through a friend and since we had a dinner scheduled with friends in town and two coming from out of town thought this would be a great place for the six of us to have dinner.  It definitely was! The downstairs part isn't open until next week, but once it opens that is where I want sit when I go!  The oversized booths look like the perfect spot to hide out with a group of friends for the evening and it's a bit more secluded with its own bar. But upstairs we got to sit in full view of the kitchen and watched them making fresh roti and naan.  For the six of us we ordered several dishes.  I ordered a Bhang Lassi to drink and even though they accidentally made me a virgin (they forgot the rum), it was delicious. The chili cheese toast was quite spicy, but I love spicy.  And it balanced well with my lassi.  The two best dishes we had as mains were, in my opinion, the Lamb Biryani and the Dishoom Tikka Chicken.  The chicken was incredibly tender and seasoned perfectly.  I could have eaten two plates of this on my own and called it dinner. The chai tea I had after dinner was possibly the best chai I've had.  Now I've not been to India yet, but I've had enough chai in my life to know a top-notch one when I taste it.  The passion fruit gola ice was very sweet and really enjoyable; the ice was very fine so it blended well with the flavouring. As a side note, the bathrooms downstairs are really nice.  Really, really nice.  The toilet stalls each have a display like an Indian medicine cabinet, which is a really unique touch. We'll certainly be going back to Dishoom.  I hope it stays as good after the opening period is over because it really is something different."
3/5/2018,5 star rating,Excellent Indian Fusion. Off the chart. Exceeded every expectation. Great staff. Friendly service. Awesome atmosphere and music.

12/9/2015,5 star rating,"Love this place! Everything we ordered was amazing! If you plan to come here def order the mattar paneer and chicken curry, hands down you will die and go to heaven! I really enjoyed the open kitchen concept, dim lighting, and restaurant atmosphere was fun and loud! Totally worth the 1 hr wait in the cold! You gotta try it!"

9/2/2011,3 star rating,"Dinner at Dishoom on a Thursday was an atmosphere. The upstairs bar and dining area was very much hopping, and the basement bar and dining area much the same. Was a bit taken back by the statement of 'an hour wait' by a server without even so much a look at the books. Turns out it was only 20 minutes. Dishoom's sharing concept is a rarity I am afraid, but it is a very welcome rarity. As others have said, it is not the finest Indian in Central, the Bollywood-esque decor isn't particularly interesting but fun, and the service is expected but not above par. The dishes were hot, the variety wide, and our hunger satisfied. We shared a couple of grill plates (the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and  Mushroom Paneer), some Lamb Biryani, and the Chili Cheese Toast. I would patronize again."
11/8/2012,4 star rating,"Sweet Jesus I want to sample everything on their menu.  I've only been once, at which time I only stayed for a drink and some delicious cheesy naan, but I've seen their prices and I've smelled their food and I will return.  Oh, yes.  With many options for less than £10 (and a good selection for less than £5), there is no reason not to eat here often. There is outdoor seating available but the dining room isn't stuffy at all.  The service was a bit slow but super friendly.  And that cheesy naan and cocktail?  You had me at hello."
24/1/2016,2 star rating,"Don't believe the hype. Long wait. Average food at best. My naan was cold and burned. The samosas were made with phyllo dough and had very little and not great tasting filling, and the service was terrible. I literally had to yell at my server for water as he ran away from the table next to me where he was filling water."
7/10/2011,4 star rating,"Wow - I can see why Yelpers have been making this place popular! We came in hungry - and left with warm happy stomachs.   The chicken tikka is what really stood out in its awesomeness. The chicken was nice and moist, and sooooo full of flavo(u)r. Order this with naan or garlic naan - and you are (almost) set. I say ""almost"" as the portion sizes are such that the customer is enabled to order a variety of different dishes without ""overeating"".  (Next time I'll consider ordering two of these and 2xnaan). The calamari was also an excellent dish - a small bowl of very lightly breaded calamari. It was a nice change from what I'm used to - as the calamari isn't completely covered in batter and fried. This is certainly worth a try for a change of pace. The final dish was the real kicker... (by kicker - i mean it kicked us in the ass!). Lamb curry (I think it was listed as Lamb Biryani on this menu). We ordered this with rice as it came with just the main curry, and wow - they kicked it up a nice notch. A fairly spicy dish with not quite as much flavor as the chicken tikka - at least worth a shot for the super hot lovers, but I would have liked a ""fuller"" flavo(u)r. Aside from the food, the service was excellent (especially considering the crowds vs the # of servers), and the atmosphere was cool. It was nice that it was relatively casual for a cool London restaurant spot. I can see us going back for sure."
11/11/2015,5 star rating,"My friends told me I couldn't leave London without trying some Indian food, so after looking up Indian restaurants on yelp I stumbled onto Dishoom. I came here for lunch and was really looking forward to trying some Indian curry. There is also a breakfast menu here that looked really good and one of my regrets was not being able to try that. I came without a reservation on a Monday and there was a slight wait, but was able to get seated within 10 minutes. I ordered the Chicken Ruby with steamed Basmati rice. By far the best curry I have ever had and went well with the rice (I should have ordered naan too!). To my surprise, when I got my bill, I found out they had an event on Mondays where you roll a die and if you get a certain number, your meal is free! However, my luck wasn't great that day...whole meal came out to about £11. I would recommend this place to anyone exploring London and looking for good Indian food!"
4/5/2012,5 star rating,"It took two attempts before we could grab a table. Dishoom does not accept reservations unless for parties of 6 or more. Your best bet is to arrive before 6pm to get a table, otherwise, it is an average of an hour for a table. There is a small bar section downstairs while you wait for a table. The vibe here is full of energy! Pimms lemonade and lukosowa cocktail was the poison of the evening -- they were very refreshing for the spicy food that was to come. For London, the price on the cocktail was rather reasonable. For the food, we decided to do a tasting sample. Be sure you ask for the heat index, we didn't and got ourselves into a pinch half way through dinner. The dome oven was broken, so that was a bummer. Most dishes are appetizer size, so you'll need about 2- 3 dishes per person. But, don't let the waiter influence your decision, order as you go along. Garlic Naan: crispy and packed with garlic, you almost don't taste the bread. It's a garlic lover's dream come true! Bhel: we were a little surprised by this rice cracker dish which has the texture of rice crispy cereal providing for a neat texture. Don't be fooled by the berries, you'll gonna need that sweetness once the heat hits - it gets you at the back of your throat. Chicken Berry Biryani: curry chicken, slow cooked, served over rice and a full serving. This was a great medium heat dish. Vada Pau: spiced potato and chutney in a bun. Two buns per order. One bit per bun. Dhaba Chicken: curry chicken that was a bit too spicy, a rather small serving. Mago & Fennel Lassi: cold refreshing drink to help cool your mouth.  This is yogurt based. Half way through the meal, my mouth was on fire.  Another waitress saw me starting to swell up as I tried in vain to wave cool air into my mouth. He brought over Raita, a cool cucumber yogurt sauce, on the house. It was a really nice gesture and did the trick. Shortly after, the house manager came by and asked if we needed any more bread, also on the house.  I was too embarrassed to say yes - however, very appreciative of their service."

6/11/2015,4 star rating,"I prefer the Shoreditch location as the atmosphere there is better, but the food is always delicious.  A nice alternative breakfast as the bacon naan roll and coffee are very good."
22/4/2016,2 star rating,"I visited Dishoom with colleagues from work with our lovely Indian friend leading the way as he advises and suggests stuff to help us make the best decisions mixing what we fancy and his experience and knowledge.. Now on the Dishoom diner I was rather disappointed! The food was all right but not impressive at all, to my taste the decoration etc. was pretty nice and I appreciated that. but what's even more important is food, and I believe it was not great and it was overpriced and expensive... Not to mention the super packed aspect to the experience, which is sort of OK when it's a very nice place, you think it's worth the hassle; but this added on the disappointment since I would't get / couldn't justify this for the food I had at all!"
18/7/2013,4 star rating,"A really solid place with a different approach to Indian. Service was fine - nothing over the top but we were also not left wanting. The food was great - the halibut cheeks were well worth it as was the keema pau to start. While not disappointed by the lamb biryani I also wasn't blown away by it either. The murgh malai however was fantastic - the chicken was cooked to perfection. Location is obviously great and the place itself was really good - great ambiance, nice communal and also individual seating options. Well worth a visit."
20/4/2016,4 star rating,"Worth the queue! Excellent food, good service! Tip: go for or around 6pm much easier to find a table can often walk in any later and there will be a long queue."
18/4/2016,4 star rating,"Great choice of dishes for every meal time, including a Dishoom breakfast! As well as Dairy free and Gluten free options, which are not limited to one or two substitute dishes. We had a fabulous meal here last week and will continue to come back to Dishoom again and again, as they offer something for everyone."
28/10/2017,4 star rating,"Luckily we made reservations 1 week in advance, and we didn't have to wait in the very long queue . Service was great ,( our waitress Kay was very helpful and nice ) food was good , reasonably priced . Great selection."
9/7/2017,5 star rating,"This place was fantastic. Once I entered I was overwhelmed with so many delicious smells--I wanted to try everything! Our server (whose. And I wish I remembered) was very helpful annd enthusiastic. We had the garlic naan, black daal, lamb chops, their version of the tikka masala (I forget the name of it on the menu) and the side of greens. Everything was delicious but the black daal, lamp chops and tiki masala were exceptional. Highly recommend."
26/4/2015,3 star rating,"very good food but not better than the Indian food you get in Berlin. It's quite expensive for a supposedly high class Indian meal at a top location. at the end i felt like i paid way too much for a good indian meal i could also get else where. the cue can go from 30 min (when you're lucky) to 2 hours before you can get seated at a table. nice atmosphere and caring waitresses/waiters. I almost walked straight in and ignored the hostesses at the door as they were wearing jeans, chucks and leather jackets and looked like students at a part time job."
7/1/2016,4 star rating,"I tried the keema pau, pav bhaji and dishoom chicken tikka role. Pav bhaji was excellent.. A liitle less oil and the keema pau would make it to the 5 star list... The chicken tikka tole was also good and had a flavor resembling thai peanut sauce... The staff is always smiling and the service is fast and excellent."
20/8/2017,5 star rating,This is our go to place for Indian in London -- the city with plenty of super Indian restaurants. Choose from among the many small dishes. Service is always crisp and attentive. But the real start of the show is the food.
4/7/2017,4 star rating,"It's very good but not sure if it's mind blowing and worth waiting in a long queue. I ate here for an early lunch which was fairly easy but during the evenings I saw quite a line. The dishes are more subtle and don't leave you feeling heavy, which is really nice but I wouldn't say that I thought the food was any better than the affordable, non-hole-in-the-wall Indian restaurants in most major cities. Worth a try but not worth a wait."
16/8/2012,4 star rating,"I have walked past Dishoom on various occasions and was happy to have a good reason to enter as part of last night's Qype Review Crawl. The downstairs area reminded me of a German beer cellar and will come into its own in winter, I am sure (a bit dark for my liking when outdoors is treated to a rare ray of sunshine). Dishoom is the perfect place for a quick bite to eat and perfectly located for pre-theatre dinner, etc. We were all quite intrigued by the breakfast menu which starts at 8am  excellent idea! I am a big fan of tapas-style menus as I can never make up my mind and love the idea of tasting many different flavours. The portions are quite generous and the hardest decision will be when to stop ordering. We were lucky to be introduced to the head chef and learnt a bit more about the menu which is a collection of favourite dishes from different regions in India  apparently there is no other place where you'd find a similar variety. We sampled a Bombay take on Pimms  a particular hit with fans of ginger beer!"
1/4/2016,4 star rating,Dishoom is a great place for enjoying india food with a wild menu and very pleasant service. My favourite ones are the one in kings cross and the one in shoreditch where you can wait for a free table while having a cocktail
27/12/2017,5 star rating,Loved it! Best place to try some Indian cuisine and experience a retro setting! The appetizers were great!
8/10/2017,5 star rating,"I highly recommend this place.  I had to try Indian food in London and it was amazing.  We had the Chicken Ruby, Jackfruit, Lamb Boti Kabab and so much more.  Plates are small enough that you can order a bunch and share.  Great experience over all.  It was worth the 1 hour wait to be seated."
6/8/2015,4 star rating,The only bad thing I can say is the wait for a table. Great customers service and food. The lamb samosa was delicious but very small and pricey. Loved the black dalh and ruby chicken.
24/3/2016,5 star rating,"We had a brilliant weekday lunch at Dishoom Covent Garden. The food was all perfectly cooked, the okra fries were moreish, the chilli cheese toast was a very generous portion, both the mattar paneer and chicken ruby curries were flavourful and well spiced and the lamb we had was very tender and cooked perfectly. We also had some delicious desserts such as the Memsahib's Mess and also kulfi which were a brilliant sweet end to the meal.   The service was also very attentive and the food came quickly. I've been raving about Dishoom to my friend ever since! The only disappointing part of the meal was a large group of children seemingly unattended at a neighbouring table who were incredibly loud however this was a one off and was not the fault of the staff. 5*"
17/10/2010,4 star rating,"I take back everything I ever said about London having no food scene. I didn't know what I was talking about, clearly influenced by things I *might* have read in inaccurate magazines. Besides, people (me) who haven't been there in ten years have no business making assumptions. This trip changed my perception of London completely (from meh to love), and food was part of that. All thanks to Dishoom. My business partners wanted to take me someplace a little more authentic, off the Mayfair scene and into another neighborhood. I was so game. If nothing else, it returned the Mission/SoMa favor when they were in town a few months ago. I knew Dishoom and I were going to get along splendidly upon walking in and seeing one of the most beautiful clocks ever taking a iconic spot in the decor. Right above the kitchen, it's striking, and I want it. If my SF loft ever materializes, the Dishoom clock is going to be a featured part of the decor. Which means I'll have to go back to get it, which would be no problem at all. The four of us split some outstanding dishes: - Grilled chicken that became part of delicious roti rolls that rivaled my favorites at Kasa (yelp.com/biz/kasa-indian…) - Stunningly good lobster straight out of the shell - Black daal that complemented the above perfectly - Fresh mangoes with vanilla yogurt. Can't. Ever. Get. Enough. Everything was washed down with a DG&T (gin, tonic and a few drops of Indian ginseng). Score. Only the veggie biryani underwhelmed. It could have used more veggies, less rice. From clocks to eats to drinks, it was a wonderful dinner out. My bad London, my bad. This SF foodie has never so loved being wrong."
3/10/2011,5 star rating,"Ever since I discovered Dishoom earlier this year, I've become an ardent fan. What strikes me as the most charming and defining feature of ""Dishoom"" was the concept that it pays homage to, that of, Irani cafes in mid-20th century Bombay. ""Dishoom"" opened its doors in July 2010. Adorned with sepia toned portraiture and popular imagery from the 50s and 60s against the backdrop of powder blue walls, it is obvious that much thought and effort has gone into the decor and cultural referencing. I admit to this bias but given the plethora of Pakistani restaurants in London that serve food exactly how I would enjoy it back home, I rarely venture to Indian restaurants. However, Dishoom has changed that for me. During multiple visits I have enjoyed the simple, clean flavors and moderately spiced food.  The stellar item on the menu is, undoubtedly, the chai. It's traditional milky tea with a lingering aftertaste of cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and a hint of ginger. Amongst the starters/small plates the pau bhaji, calamari, vada pau and bhel stand out. I also enjoy the grilled items accompanied with velvety roomali roti or cheese nans. They also serve delicious breakfast. I have tried the Bombay Omelette and the Bombay Breakfast Bake, both of which were excellent especially the latter.   Dishoom is one of the rare restaurants where most items on the menu are standouts and rarely disappoint. It's also good value for money, especially give the central location."
28/7/2015,5 star rating,"This is probably my favorite Indian restaurant that I have ever been to. The black daal, that is all I can say. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I love nearly everything that I have ordered here (Okra fries), but would not recommend their cocktails. One was actually really bad. Other than that, the service is friendly and you need a party of 6 or more to get a table. Really annoying considering the wait line takes an hour at least. If you can get in, I would highly recommend eating here. I was waiting for this meal for weeks when we finally got to London."
15/5/2017,4 star rating,Very good! Sad that we didn't get to try it for dinner since the line was too long and it was raining but I can understand why it's so popular!
11/12/2015,5 star rating,"OMG, I still dream of their food at nights.. Spicy, tasty, and surprising. We also had a cocktail before we were seated, very unique, lovely. Although the restaurant was full the service was very good and efficient. The place is a bit loud but that did not preventus from having a great late lunch."
17/12/2012,3 star rating,"We took a colleague from India here and he felt that it had some of the most authentic Mumbai food he had seen in London so far. To be honest, I thought it was ok rather than great. We were in a booth downstairs which was actually very nice, but the service was a little slow / unhelpful. The food when it came was fine, but to be honest I have no strong desire to go back."
4/6/2017,3 star rating,"Very average food if you know what indian food should taste like. Overall ambience and concept is nice, they have good indian fusion drinks. But as an Indian living in New York and visiting London, Indian food in NY is far better and authentic. To be fair, if you are in the area, this is probably your best bet"
5/5/2015,5 star rating,"There was a large line outside, but it is totally worth it. We had a great server Adrienn and ordered Black Dahl, Chicken Tikka, Plain Naan, Matar Paneer, Cinnamon Ice Crean and Pistachio Kulfi. Definitely a meal that will not be forgotten."
12/9/2010,3 star rating,"Dishoom = disappointment.  The concept is great and we liked their effort to replicate a Bombay cafe (although we could have done without the incense burning and I didn't like that you can see the computer screen with the orders by the kitchen. But....the service was poor.  It was empty when we went there, but water glasses laid empty, no one checked up on us, we had to wave to get their attention and when my friend ordered butter on the side for her naan, it didn't appear.   The food was just ok.  My friend was actually quite miserable with her £2 naan which was a bit too charred and thought her lamb was overcooked and the lamb salad which was basically lamb with lettuce was overpriced.  I had a roti sandwich--felt like a glorified wrap and I did order the pau bhaji which was tasty.  I didn't appreciate the lack of a free refill on the chai. My friend expressed her unhappiness so we were treated to a free dessert.  The warm chocolate fondant was not warm, so again disappointment.  I was okay with the place--my friend thought it was way overpriced for what we got."
2/3/2016,5 star rating,Beautiful food! Had to wait a while to get seated but the cocktails were delicious and the plates were so fun to share and try once we sat down. Not even as expensive as we thought it would be! We left very full of high quality food and for reasonable price. The lighting and music is fantastic. Buy their compilation soundtrack - they sell it on the menu!
22/12/2010,4 star rating,"Great curry in Central! I liked this place, it has a funky vibe to it, full of mostly Young Urban Professionals... The staff are very attentive and cool. The food ive go as far as saying it is one of the best indian food joints in Central London, fresh, tasteful and all the spice seemed to be balanced incredibly well. Looking forward to returning soon."

9/10/2014,5 star rating,"This is by far the BEST indian meal I have ever eaten at an Indian restaurant, and that says a ton coming from an Indian. The pau bhaji transported me back to my childhood, all around spectacular. (My girlfriend wrote this, in case you are wondering -- and I wholeheartedly agree!!)"
22/11/2015,5 star rating,"Amazing experience!  Arrived early on a Sunday evening (5:45p) and waited outside in the chilly November weather for 25 minutes before getting the all-clear to wait in the bar downstairs (for another 20 minutes). Super cool place with great service. Our friendly hostess outside kept us informed and entertained. Lovely chai drinks kept us toasty while we waited. The bar wait was pleasant as well. When we got to our table out waiter was amazing with perfect recommendations. Top 5 dinners my husband and I have had - including Sydney, Nice, San Francisco and Buenos Aires. We will return to enjoy the ruby chicken, fried okra, maslasa prawn, and the black bean dall (the bomb!). Don't miss it!  Worth the wait!"
19/11/2015,4 star rating,"Found this place using Yelp, and happy I did. There was a wait to get in, but it was not very long at almost 10pm and flying solo. Staff were all very friendly and my waiter had a grasp on the menu and was able to answer questions I had. The food. I ordered chili bread(?) appetizer, ruby chicken, basmati rice, and garlic naan. My main, rice and naan actually came out before my starter, which was a little surprising, but worked out fine as I dipped the bread in the ruby sauce. Chili bread was tasty, but really nothing to get excited about. Rice was very good and cooked to perfection. Garlic naan was good, but a little thick around the edges. I like a little bit of heat with my Indian food (usually a vindaloo guy), but the waiter warned me that non of their dishes were overtly spicy hot.  The ruby chicken was supposed to be one of the spicer dishes available. It had great flavor and was very tender, but was missing the heat I really wanted. They did serve some little sauces which included a pepper one, that did help a bit. I have found in general the British are a little tame when it comes to adding heat, so I'm sure this is partially why there is nothing ""hot"" on the menu. Prices are a little much for the portion sizes. High quality food, lacking heat, but tasty."
17/11/2012,5 star rating,"Whenever I travel from America to London I eat as much Indian food as I can.  I stumbled into Dishoom one night with a friend and couldn't have been happier.  I wouldn't consider it your ""typical"" Indian restaurant.  It's very cool and sleek with a modern twist on Indian classics.  We started with a recommendation from our server and ordered the Bhel.  I had no idea what to expect because it sounded - - well it sounded weird.  YUM-YUM-YUM.  We then split the Chicken Berry Britannia and Mattar Paneer.  I can't tell you which one was better - they both rocked !!  The cheese Naan is also AMAZING. I can't wait to come back to London and eat at Dishoom again.  If you are in the area.  Do yourself a favor and stop in.  If it's a weekend night, make a reservation or plan to wait."
27/6/2015,4 star rating,"One of the reasons I like traveling to London is the Indian food. Dishoom does not disappoint, their dishes are full of flavor and the lamb dish I had was surprisingly spicy, which I like. Save room for desert."
7/2/2018,5 star rating,Awesome place . Worth the queue. Food/atmosphere/ staff . They have nailed this one to perfection
23/8/2013,4 star rating,"We went there 3 times for breakfast. The food is really good and of good quality. Quantity is sometimes small but it is enough. The egg nan roll with bacon was a favorite around the table. I had porridge and granola (which was really good but very small :-)), mango lassi was specially fresh, chai a little tangy but appreciated. The issue with the restaurant is the service. We had great service twice (foreigners with accents and great attitudes) and a really bad one, once (an irish guy not awake and limit intrusive, laying over the table while taking the order, is a NO for us). Otherwise everybody was very smilling, even the cook behind the nan oven :-) thanks for the delicious food."
3/2/2016,4 star rating,"The wait can be long (although it's usually faster than they tell you) but it's delicious! Great ambiance and drinks as well. The brunch at Dishoom is divine: eggs, naan and sausage. Need I say more?"
18/8/2017,3 star rating,"Food was alright, nothing to brag about.  Portions are very small in comparison to the prices."
30/5/2011,3 star rating,"I took my sister and her Indian in-laws there and they loved it. What I think makes this Mumbai-inspired chain successful is that it's a subtle cross between East and West. The menu has all the classics you'd expect at your local deli; biryani, curries, kofta, naans etc. but the menu is designed to suit Western palates. I think it's a tad too pricey given the quantities but the  flavour and refinement make it worth the money. However, if you're looking for homely, comforting food, it's probably not the right place. The restaurant has a sophisticated and cosmopolitan vibe to it. If you go there in 5+ groups you'll get better value if you order different dishes everyone can eat from, tapas-style."
24/10/2017,5 star rating,Dishoom is di-licious. Go and see for yourself. You'll be glad you did. Food is incredible and service is so good. Highly recommend.

5/6/2015,4 star rating,"My friends and I had originally spotted Dishoom while staying at Shoreditch  but it had been a Friday night so the restaurant was crowded and we didn't feel like waiting; fortunately, on our trip to Covent Garden we passed by it and decided to venture in as the line was not long. We were impressed by the staff's efficiency in getting us seated and their communication with one another. The menu looked divine and I ordered the black daal and naan, while my friends ordered vegetable samosas, chicken ruby and a potato dish. The food arrived promptly and everything tasted absolutely fantastic. I've had daal in several places before but the daal at dishoom was some of the best I've ever had. We finished off the meal with mango kulfi, a rich, creamy mango Popsicle which was the perfect finale to a great meal. Prices are good for the quality of the food and the restaurant has a lovely ambience."
17/10/2015,5 star rating,Lovely Indian fusion kitchen. Love their chicken ruby and their murgh malai. And try the okra fries - they're fantastic. Sweet and helpful staff all the way round. Only been there at lunchtime and thus avoided the lineup outside. Will most definitely return when in London next time.

10/4/2017,5 star rating,"If you're in London and looking for some delicious, satisfying Indian food, this is the place to go. We waited over an hour in line and it was so worth it. They were serving free small drinks to those waiting in line, which is very nice. All the staff were pleasant. On to the food--My husband and I are curry lovers, and their curry is definitely one of the best we've ever had. Even the rice was spectacular--how does one even make Basmati rice spectacular??? I don't know, but they sure did. I was looking at starters and desserts, but all we had to eat was that one curry and we were so stuffed and satisfied. I will also note, I have Celiac Disease and the wait staff was very well informed and kind when dealing with me and my needs. There are plenty of gluten free options on the menu. I didn't get sick at all, which means their kitchen did what was necessary to keep my food safe during preparation. Overall, a great experience."
8/1/2013,4 star rating,"Would it be weird to come here to have a meal consisted entirely of lassis?  Probably.  But if that gives me more of an excuse to check out the awesome bathroom stalls at Dishoom, so be it (simply to check out the medicine cabinets!) If you're looking for something other than the amazing lassis (I tried the Rose and Cardamom, which I preferred over the Bhang), Dishoom has plentiful selection of items that require chew.  I came with a friend who was both vegetarian AND allergic to tomatoes, so this time around did not order any meat dishes.  We did order: Far Far: bowl full of chips (or what your Brits call crisps) with texture like prawn crackers Cheese naan: naan with layer of cheese in the middle, delicious! Skate cheeks: fried morsels of fish (was the least excited about this one) Calamari: great with the sauce provided Paneer Tikka: skewer of grilled cheese and peppers Pineapple and black pepper crumble: lots of pineapple chunks! Really liked this place and its location, will be back for sure!"

13/1/2012,3 star rating,"Nice Indian street food style food which is quite trendy at the moment. Good size portions for sharing. Bit pricey for what you get but it is Covent Garden. I didn't rate the calamari or the chilli cheese toast. Calamari was really oily, small bity bits and the toast was just that - toast....... It's better than the usual English curry houses so handy for a quick Indian fix but still a bit too trendy for me. I like my Indian food in a no frillls way."
26/4/2012,3 star rating,"Dishoom is the sound a Bollywood film hero makes when he lands a good punch. How cool is that? The restaurant (although they call themselves a Bombay café) is pretty cool as well. Consisting of two floors, it's routinely packed to the afters on Friday and Saturday nights. Even for a  table for 3 at 6pm, the wait was 30mins so if going make sure to make a reservation or leave a margin for waiting. A quick pre-theatre meal this is not. I've been wanting to go for ages since one of my Indian friends had raved about the dal and biriyani. So I grabbed him and another of my brown brethren and the three of us headed off to Dishoom for dinner. As noted above, we had a wait so off to the downstairs bar we went. Dishoom doesn't have an extensive cocktail list (although I imagine any of the standard drinks would be provided upon request if you so asked) but it does have several classics rejuvenated with a Desi twist. I opted for the Chaijito which as the name suggests is a Chai infused mojito. I was a bit doubtful of a lime and chai tea flavour mix but I have to say it was spectacular. The clean crisp flavours of the lime just barely sweetened with sugar refreshed the palatte while the chai added a playful note without any of the cloudy and cloying after taste you get in a chai tea latte. My friends' Bollywood Bellini and some form of punch were also good but I would stick with my choice as being the best. After about 20-25 minutes we were seated in a cosy table upstairs. Naturally, we ordered the house dal (a black lentil dal rather than the traditional red or orange) and a lamb biriyani with masala prawns for a starter. The prawns were good in their own right however could have used more masala to truly be masala prawn. The dal was delicious with a sharp bite and a deeper burn from the chillies used. The biriyani was tasty but nothing on what my mom makes (and since she made it a few days ago it had to contend with my recent taste memory). The garlic naan was sorely disappointed and looked more like a garlic topped Ryvita cracker than any real attempt at a naan. I hope ours was just an anomaly as a good naan is an essential pillar of a good Indian restaurant. Overall, it's a bit expensive but a fun and tasty experience. Keep in mind this is more grilled type of Indian cooking rather than an abundance of curries (going North rather than South) but overall a good time. Definitely worked a treat as a pre-night out classy spot! I really want to go back for breakfast and get a bacon naan roll!"
4/4/2017,4 star rating,"I'm not a big fan of Indian food, but I did enjoy my meal here...the cheese and the garlic  naan were both very good. Unfortunately I'd have to have a menu to give the proper names of the dishes...but the rice and chicken dish was good, rice well cooked and the chicken was nicely seasoned, the lamb samosa was very good...pastry flaky and minced lamb well done, the mint sauce went well with it.  The prawns were well cooked, however because of size I feel they should have been called shrimp...but what do I know about labeling! I have to say the service was excellent, our server was on top of everything, the decor is very nice and the enclosed booths are roomy and provide privacy.  If you like bourbon try the viceroy."
19/7/2015,5 star rating,Some of the best Indian food I've ever had. I always make time for dishoom on every trip to London.
7/2/2013,3 star rating,"We came here back in Dec 2012 after doing some yelp research. Thank goodness they have yelp in London. The service was great but it was a little loud, so it was kind of hard to hear sometimes. The hubby was going to order a dish he thought would be saucy and luckily our waitress gave us recommendation.  Good thing that happened because we would have ordered the naan for nothing.  The mango lassi was one of the best!! I wanted to order two of them.  I ordered the chicken ruby curry and got rice and an order of the roti... The husband ordered the murgh malai. Both dishes were really really good. We also ordered the cheese naan which the hubby finished all before the entree got to the table. I'm still thinking  about their mango lassi.... The only thing I didn't like was where we got seated.. it was right by the door and hostess station.  It gets pretty packed for dinner.  I took the seat because we were tired and hungry and didn't want to wait for another table."
22/3/2014,4 star rating,"Hands down one of the better Indian restaurants I have been to. This place was packed, waited over an hour to get seated but it was worth the wait. We ordered the okra fries, dishoom chicken tikka, house black daal, chicken berry britannia, and garlic naan. All of these items were delicious, especially the house black daal which is a signature dish at Dishoom."
23/9/2017,5 star rating,One of the best Indian food I've had. Showed up around 3:30 pm with a party of 4 and was seated within 5 minutes. Great and attentive service staff. Everyone loved their food and we all had to order extra roti to finish off the sauce. Can't say enough nice things!
11/7/2015,5 star rating,"Food was delicious and service really great. We ordered a curry and the cranberry chicken and I would definitely recommend the mint yogurt to go with it. I honestly didn't care for the chai, it had chewy stuff in (?) but everything else was heaven."
9/5/2015,5 star rating,Everything about the place is great. There is a bar downstairs they allow you into before dinner to break up the wait. Then once your table is ready they have a very courteous wait staff. the food is great and my only tip would be to get the fried okra.
22/9/2015,5 star rating,The best Indian food my wife and I had ever had. Get the Black Daal. Excellent service. Waited 70 minutes to get in. Well worth it. Go there now!
29/9/2016,5 star rating,"#TriggsEatLondon continued with dinner at this wildly popular spot. Easy to see why. We were able to get a table for 4 at 5pm with only a short wait. By the time we left an hour later the restaurant was full and a solid line outside. Good service with attentive staff & willing to share open insights into menu. Nothing we ordered was disappointing. Okra fries. Lamb samosas. Wanted to try their version of chickentikka but one member of our party wasn't keen on spicy dishes & the waitress was able to help us head this off. Murgh malai & masala prawns were splendid, the char on the prawns particularly excellent. But stand out was the Ruby Chicken, a curry with melt in your mouth chicken. I also treated myself to one of their cocktails, the Bombay Pimms & can heartily recommend. £25 a head seemed reasonable for the range of dishes. And excellent service in what was becoming a very busy room. Look like a chain across London. Recommend a visit"
1/3/2016,4 star rating,Killer Indian food with a twist. Highly recommend
16/3/2015,2 star rating,"Its more flash than bang, as trendy Indian places go. The lines are too long and the food does not merit the wait. However the ambience is great and the cocktails are great. The interior decor evokes the Irani/Parsi restaurants one used to find in Bombay."
5/1/2017,4 star rating,"Having never tried Indian cuisine before, I wasn't sure what to expect when going to Dishoom, and perhaps a bit nervous. It became clear quickly that it is a very popular spot in London, with over an hour wait for a table. Good sign then, if people are lining up out the door, it must be good. The hostess offered chai tea to us while we stood outside freezing, which was a nice touch. The inside is casual and cozy but vibrant as well. I went with friends who have been before, so I basically tried everything they ordered in a family style sort of set up. The food definitely exceeded my expectations, it was delicious! I tried several things, from vegetable samosas to chicken tikka, and I was pleasantly surprised with it all. I didn't think I would be one for Indian food, considering the heavy emphasis on spices, but it was all very flavorful. It might not be my first choice in cuisine for London, but it was certainly enjoyable no less."
11/12/2015,5 star rating,"We absolutely loved our visit to Dishoom Covent Garden last week. It was my birthday meal, we'd never been to Dishoom before, but our host guided us perfectly through the meal and their recommendations and we had a great experience. The timing and pace of the meal was perfect, and the food and drinks were really great. We finished everything: it was colourful, fresh, with individual dishes bringing great variety to the table. We'll definitely be back for more. We were really pleased with how reasonable the prices were for the food as well- why would we go anywhere else? Dishoom is my new favourite Indian restaurant. N.B Booking is highly recommended as it is very popular particularly in the evening."
6/9/2015,5 star rating,"Fantastic vegetarian food! My wife and I split the Pau Bahji, Paneer Tikka, House Black Daal, and Bowl of Greens, with the Roomali Roti and Steamed Basmati Rice--so, so amazing! The Chili Martini was also fantastic! This might be the best Indian food I've ever had."
6/3/2015,4 star rating,"With rave reviews on Yelp, we waited 45 minutes for a table at Dishoom.  Was it worth it?  Most likely yes.  45 minutes is still a long time to wait.  Thankfully, small cups of chai and mint tea were brought out for customers queuing in the frigid January air.  Inside, the restaurant is beautiful laid out and decorated, like a Bombay brasserie of sorts.  The atmosphere is electric yet casual.  As an appetizer at the bar, we tried the calamari, which was excellent - light, crispy, with an exquisite sweet and salty drizzle.  For dinner, we shared dishes of murgh malai, house black daal, chicken ruby, a bowl of greens, basmati rice, and a side of deliciously fluffy naan.  Everything was delicious - I only wish I could have tried the whole menu!"
15/5/2016,5 star rating,"I had some friends from out of town visiting me so of course wanted to take them to the BEST Indian in London. Alas, of course, reservations were filled up a week ahead of time, so we decided to endure the queuing b/c it's worth it. And is it worth it. Just come with the right mindset. We went on a Saturday night around 7pm and ended up waiting 2 hours (knowingly). But they make the waiting experience as best as possible: offer chai tea and sherry samples outside, there are heat lamps to keep you warm, and once you're inside, you're sent to the bar to continue the wait but with drinks and nibbles in hand. If you're coming with good company, you don't really notice the wait. Once seated at our table, we had excellent service and of course, don't have to reiterate, the food is to die for. We were literally silent for about 10 minutes while everyone scarfed their food down. My mom always says that the chef's best compliment is silence. ;) Have been told this place is great for breakfast, so will have to do that sometime soon!"
23/6/2015,5 star rating,"Outstanding food and service. And NOT too pricey. For three eaters, with drinks, our bill was £46. The wait was long as they don't accept reservations after 6pm for parties of less than six. We had about 25 mins of waiting outside, which wasn't too bad because of the friendly staff and people, and were served tea often. Then we had another 30 mins of waiting at their downstairs bar, before collecting our buzzer. The drinks and appetizers were excellent. Do NOT miss the Kolawadi Prawns - trust me, I know Indian food. They are spicy, but not crazily so. For the main course, we had the following all excellent, all 5-star dishes: the Ruby Chicken (not for those that love very spicy Indian food and like all their Indian meals to be mad spicy), the chicken biryani, rumali rotis, black daal, and a pistachio kulfi (on a thin, pointy stick, just like in India!) for dessert. OUTSTANDING!"
5/2/2013,5 star rating,"Yelped indian food when i was in London and this place popped.  Have to say that i was not disappointed.  when we arrived, the hostess said it was a 45 minute wait, which actually turned out to be a 10 minute wait.  We ordered the Soft Shell Crab Special, Chicken Ruby, and House Black Daal.  The Soft Shell Crab Special was definetly a delicious surprise.  I haven't come across anything like it here in the states.  The Chickey Ruby was fantastic as well.  I expected the chicken to be dry and tasteless, but it was totally the opposite.  Definetly get the House Black Daal.  Great little side dish with tons of flavor and perfect for dipping your naan or just by itself.   Two things you need to get when you're there - Chai and the Kulfi on a stick.  The Chai is spicy, hot and perfect for a cold London night.  The Kulfi tasted like creamy condensed milk on a stick.  Awesomely sweet and a great way to end our dinner. We kind of over ordered for two people, but it was worth it.  The next time i'm in London, i'm going to stop by.  Maybe try the Spicy Lamp Chops. Service: Fantastic.  Our waitress from Berkeley was very attentive and always came back to check on us and ask if we needed anything else."
5/10/2016,5 star rating,"Oh My God Becky - this place rocks! Went last night after the theater, arriving after ten and it was packed, but got a table very quickly (good way around the lines - go late). It's got a great, crazy energy and love the decor! The husband and I shared okra fries and calamari with sauces and -- YUMM! Just the right amount of spice and so good! Then we shared the Ruby Chicken - I guess there is a God because it's the only way this dish could exist, and Lamb Boti Kabab with rice and a good helping of Roomali Roti to soak it all up with. Didn't try dessert because we wanted those spices to last forever. And the service? Right from the door it was perfection -- our waiter --OH HEY THERE ALI! - was hands down the best we've ever had -- great food guidance, amazing attention, and a quick discussion about the world political mess - what more can you ask for?  We're going back for breakfast and Ali has already guided our ordering. PLEASE OPEN IN SAN FRANCISCO!!!"
18/4/2015,5 star rating,We came here on April 1st during one of the coldest days in London with harsh winds hoping to get in for some fine Indian food. The line was already long and out the door and the quoted wait was one hour. We stood in line freezing and got served hot mint tea while waiting. The wait came to precisely one hour and we got in. Oh that felt so good and then the food was outright delicious. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. The waiter was very helpful and patient. We are from the USA and really enjoyed the meal. It deserves 5 stars and well worth the long line wait.  Highly recommend!
29/6/2012,4 star rating,This is one of the hippest Indian restaurants that I've been to.  The food and the service was solid and luckily you don't walk out smelling like a ton of spices....  the one negative is that they didn't really have any cold beer.  They did however look both upstairs and downstairs to try to find colder ones.
11/1/2015,5 star rating,So amazing! Great food great service! This place has the best indian food I've ever had! Get the ruby curry! It won't disappoint :)
17/6/2017,5 star rating,Wow amazing. From the usa we were expecting a much stronger curry flavor which does not appeal to my family.  Everyone liked just about everything. Loved the grilled chicken and lamb. The calamari was amazing.  Nan was good but the thin roti was the best.  And we all really liked the red curry chicken not to strong.  So good.
3/2/2016,2 star rating,"Overrated, overpriced. The food is good, the atmosphere is ok (when not overcrowded), this poor chain of restaurants is a victim of its own success - not for people who actually want to enjoy their food AND their conversation. On the plus side, definitely worth a try, the food is quite nice. Just not living up to the hype it has."
11/6/2015,3 star rating,"People rave about this place but I've never gotten the fuss. Can see the appeal if you are eating with a large group and share some dishes, but I'd always opt for a more run of the mill local Indian if given the choice."
26/8/2012,4 star rating,"light, well-seasoned tandoori entrees. Craving indian, yelp led me here. Ample space and seating (main floor and basement). I ordered the garlic naan and chicken tandoori. the naan was good, garlic-fragrant. The chicken tandoori blew me away. Usually at most restaurants I've been to, the tandoori is always this eerie red color. Here, it was more of a grilled chicken color. It was light and very well seasoned with a touch of spiciness. I was super stuffed, but didn't feel bloated. I was spying samosas on the tables around me which I will try on my next go. Will be back eventually."
27/3/2014,4 star rating,Glad we got a chance to grab lunch here before our trip to London was over. Our group ordered a lot of food and they were all pretty good. The chai tea was interesting but good. It was mildy sweet and tasted like it had ginger in it. The lamb samosas could use a little bit more flavor but I enjoyed it. The fried calamari was nice and crispy and had a sweet and spicy flavor to it. The chicken curry was spicy but rich in flavor. I love Indian curry so it's a dish I would def order again. I'm not sure of the exact name of the dish but I think it's called the chicken tikka. Love the crispy texture of the skin on the cubed pieces of chicken. It was flavored nicely and was pretty juicy. I think it's probably my favorite dish of the bunch. The spicy lamb kabob was seasoned well but I think it was a bit dry. The sheekh lamb could use a bit more flavor and was a little dry as well but I didn't mind it. My boyfriend liked it. The chef's convent garden was my my least favorite dish! I don't think anyone in my group enjoyed it either. It was actually a dip which didn't have any particular flavor to it. I probably only took one bite. The chicken pomegranate salad was nice and refreshing. Love the pomegranate seeds which gave the salad a fresh nice crunch. The ambience was enjoyable and our group had a nice time here. Glad we were able to try Indian food in London!
8/8/2014,5 star rating,"This place will change your life... well, let's not go that far... but it will at least change  your opinion of what good Indian food should look and taste like. From start to finish, our meal was amazing - highlights included the House Black Daal, Gunpowder Potatoes, Masala Prawns, and the Prawn Koliwada. Not to mention some awesome cocktails. We'd like it so much that we went back the following day for lunch and ordered the same thing before we left town."
1/4/2013,3 star rating,Dinner Very modern Indian place. I wasn't particularly impressed with food as I wasn't familiar with Indian. It's not cheap considering what you get but the feel you get is something you'd like to pay for.

22/4/2014,5 star rating,"Hands down, by far, no cpmparison, the BEST Indian food I have ever had. No lie, ever. As we arrived around 6:30 (trying to beat the crowd, ha! who were we kidding) -- there was a wait. It was a cold afternoon, and we had to wait outside as it was too full inside. Service was fantastic, and they bring you delicious piping hot chai to keep you nice and comfy while waiting. Lovely touch. As much as I love London, I find their service to be generally spotty at most restaurants. However, Dishoom was on point. We had servers constantly checking in on us. Always so attentive. It was wonderful. The food in itself was fantastic. I cannot even describe how delicious it was. My only regret is that we did not go back during our 10 day stay in London. If there was one meal worth repeating, it was certainly at Dishoom. Do not miss!"

Not a huge menu but everything we had was good.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive.  And sweet.   Highly recommended."
14/11/2015,4 star rating,"A unique menu with loads of gluten free and dairy free options. Their calamari and cocktails are to die for (on which point, I am dreaming of them bringing back their Chowpatty Beach pop-up bar - those were some awesome frozen cocktails!!!!)"
25/11/2014,4 star rating,"Husband and I have been here twice now and enjoyed both meals. The staff are all very very friendly, willing to answer any questions and offer recommendations (even if the answer is, ""everything is good!""). As a vegetarian, I don't have as much choice as I would in another Indian restaurant, but the choices I do have are all very delicious. The samosas and chilli toast are great starters, and their calamari is a little sweet as a twist. I've had the House Daal and also the paneer dish. As i said, both great, but I'd struggle to keep going back to find something new to try. However, their chocolate chai is also REALLY yum if you like chocolate and cinnamon. =) I'd recommend it to try!"
27/6/2014,5 star rating,"Fabulous meal.  The service was very attentive, we were seated right away at our reservation time.  My cocktail was delicious and my daughter loved the lassi.  All the dishes we ordered were well-spiced, flavorful, and caused me to overeat.  I would highly recommend.  Make a reservation!"

I also don't like spicy foods, so I really couldn't eat the one dish I ordered. This place isn't a good restaurant for me, but seems like it could be good for others."
9/11/2015,4 star rating,I went with a couple of friends a few months ago. Good service and lovely food at a reasonable price would definitely recommend.
10/3/2011,4 star rating,"I'm not a fan of Indian food, I mean, I like it but I wouldn't eat it on a regular basis. I really wanted to try Dishoom, though, mainly because of very good reviews I'd read and finally went there for lunch on Sunday. I loved the place, specially the decoration and furniture downstairs and the bathrooms. It's clear that a lot of attention has been taken regarding the decoration, I truly liked that. The food was very good as well. We (my boyfriend and I) weren't very hungry so we only shared three small/medium dishes: Roomali Dishoom Chicken Roll (tasty but way too spicy for me, my boyfriend ate it whole), Keema Pau (spiced minced lamb, delicious) and Dishoom calamari. The calamari were fantastic, a bit sweet, with chilli and lime, so good. I would go back to this place, specially if I had friends visiting me in London or something like that. I think it's a great place to go with a medium/large group, it feels lively, fun and very relaxed."
23/5/2011,3 star rating,"High ceilinged space with capacity for 50+ people in downstairs room made this a great setting for a company gathering.   We ate a fixed menu with lamb samosas, chili cheese toast, naan, chicken briyani, vegatable curry, chicken tikka and desserts (kulfi on a stick and gola ice). I have a nut allergy and even though my company hadn't asked about dietary restrictions they helpfully provided a menu which marked which items had nuts (unfortunately this included 2 of the items on our set menu - briyani and veggie curry).  Not to worry, they brought me out an extra main course just for me - and I chose the lamb boti kebab - which was superb! Spices are used very well to flavor the food - which did not rely of heavy sauces or too much salt to be tasty.  One of the better Indian meals I have ever had that wasn't homecooked. Note:  If you are not for spice - this is not for you.  Lots of yoghurt and lassi was needed by the non-chili-lovers at our tables.  But, if you are for spice - this is amazing! Finally, the mango kulfi was amazing."
9/1/2016,4 star rating,"By far the best Indian food I've ever had. I went with a group of friends from Pakistan and India, and they were all blown away by the quality and authenticity of the food. Our server was very friendly, but was noticeably more friendly to my South aAsian friends than he was to me--the only non-Asian at the table. I highly recommend ordering a variety of dishes and sharing them so you can taste a little bit of everything. Both the Kings Cross and Covent Garden locations are spacious and beautifully decorated, and most importantly, they take reservations. If you don't manage to reserve a table and get caught in the queue outside, they pass out chai to keep you warm, which is a great bonus. Can't wait to go back and try breakfast!"
9/8/2014,5 star rating,"If you had chicken ruby from this place, you would be dreaming about it for a while. Chicken is tender, sauce consists of mix of various spices. I wish I could go back for dinner tonight. Little far from our home, Hawaii."
16/8/2012,5 star rating,"I've known about Dishoom for a while and have seen its rave reviews so I'm glad to have had the chance to go there for the Covent Garden Review Crawl this week. The atmosphere is very cosy, with lots of different pictures everywhere, a bit dark downstairs but I quite like that at times. We tried the Bombay Pimms which was a really interesting take on normal Pimms, definitely not something I would have chosen but I enjoyed it nonetheless! We were then provided with lots of different small plates, including a bhel salad and skate cheeks which were really really lovely! Kheema Pau, a mince lamb dish with bread, was also tasty, though I think the skate cheeks were the hit of our group! Needless to say I think I'll be coming back here to try more of what this lovely Bombay Cafe has to offer."
26/7/2015,5 star rating,Phenomenal ... Especially given the reasonable price.  We came here with another couple and couldn't stop ourselves from ordering more and more as we had to try everything.  The flavors were multi-layered and exploded onto the palate.  The dishes were prepared very artfully.  Chicken Tikka was beyond anything I have tried anywhere else.  The Chicken Biryani here sets the gold standard.  The IPA beer complimented the meal perfectly.  Service was great and attentive.  I want to go on and on praising this place but now I'm just making myself sad as I'm back home in the states.  Till we meet again ... Love you London.
2/11/2014,5 star rating,"Holy cow this place is good. Didn't have to wait for a table. The staff couldn't have been nicer, or quicker. I had the chicken ruby (similar to chicken makhani) and garlic naan to sop up that butter sauce. Just the right amount of heat. The bhang lassi (drink) soothed any burn."
12/6/2012,5 star rating,"After seeing Chicago on the West End we were hungry, and it was almost 11 pm and most places in the area had stopped serving food.  As it was our last night in London, we figured we should try some Indian food, and were thrilled with Dishoom said the kitchen was still open. We all started with a Bombay Pimm's, which was an Indian inspired version of the classic Pimm's Cup; it was infused with ginger and very delicious, an excellent start to the meal! Our waiter was very patient and answered our questions, and once we ordered, the food came out fast!  We had samosas and some of the most amazing calamari ever, it came with a spicy/sweet sauce and was just melt in your mouth good! Of course we had some Naan bread, we opted for garlic and it was outstanding, we had to get a second order.  For our main dish we shared the Lamb Biryani, I had never had Biryani before, and now I am hooked!  The lamb chunks were so tender and flavorful, they melted in your mouth and the seasoned rice complimented it perfectly.  It was a bit spicy, but we got a side of cucumber raita to put on top, and the combination was amazing!  This was my sister's first time ever eating Indian food and now she is hooked!  I thought the prices were quite reasonable and the portions were big!  The inside decor is very modern, and overall it made for a wonderful final meal in London!"
14/8/2014,5 star rating,"Best breakfast in the world. Bacon nan rolls and bloody mary's. Amazing decor, great staff. I've already asked if I could live there and they've agreed to take me in."
19/10/2015,4 star rating,"Fantastic food, but an inordinately long line. I deduct a star because even when you reach the front of the line, you still have further to wait in the bar (which isn't clear when you're queuing)."
14/1/2015,2 star rating,"I found the food to be unremarkable -- it was good, but nothing special and pricier than what one could find elsewhere.  I think what makes it popular is the buzzy, bistro-like atmosphere, which is pleasant.  It has a slight tourist trap vibe (for example, the fact that servers ask if you want sparkling or still, with no explicit mention of tap water, which you can always request of course, but you have to know to do so)."
18/10/2015,4 star rating,I liked the service very much. Very good food if you like Indian flavored dishes. Long wait
30/4/2015,4 star rating,"I went with 3 friends for dinner last week and it's just as fabulous the second time around. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the tables are too small to have your beer, your plates, the condiments, and food for 4 people all together. The food itself - still fantastic, the biriyani was excellent, the prawns were yummy, the lamb was succulent. Go there. Ignore the 1 hour wait in line, you can drink chai and lime juice whilst waiting. It's always worth it."
10/12/2014,4 star rating,"I really liked this place. We had to wait nearly an hour (as warned) to get in, but they did bring us out hot chai every 10 minutes or so. It's really not bad. Once you sit down, the food comes quickly and the recommendations are spot on. Between two of us, we had - one garlic naan (5 stars), one rumali roti (3), chicken tikka dry (4), prawn masala (4), basmati rice (4), black daal (4), calamari (5), and bhel (4). Finally, for dessert, we had the chili flaked chocolate mousse (5) and the mango kulfi (4). I would be OK with the wait in warmer weather, but I think you can find equivalent food with a reservation at (say) Chutney Mary. This is right by the office, so that's a plus. If you're going on a date, plan to lean over a lot and also know that the tables are so close your conversations are public. Another yelper recommended this place and I'm glad to say she was right - it's excellent food, decently priced (except for the prawn which is 11 quid - really silly) and you cannot beat the location."
9/10/2017,5 star rating,"Go for a late lunch for little to no wait, great drinks! Surprisingly affordable for the quality of food. Great portions, not too spicy but lamb vindaloo and bhel starter had a ton of flavor. Get the kulfi, mango was excellent and authentic."

The paneer salmon and chicken salad, the bap-like sloppy joe things that are in every hole in the wall in Mumbai, and the orgasmic vanilla ice cream with mangoes dessert (okay, I know, innocent right, but really there must be ambrosia in there or something because really, vanilla and mango was THAT amazing) Though it claims to be a Bombay cafe, the decore is far more trendy and modern than anything of its kind in Mumbai (from what I saw, which wasn't very much so maybe I'm wrong).  From the lights hanging on the ceiling, to the bathrooms with generic, Indian toiletries in the glass medicine cabinet, to the cup that the receipt comes in that you need to ""ring"" to get the waiter's attention - this place is about the details.   It's a must if you're in Covent Garden and can't afford the Ivy across the street, or want a new, fresh yet casual dining experience.  There are not a lot of places like this in London -- I typically find the trendy places are over-priced and not very yummy, and the yummy places as stiff and old-world, and, well, too pricey too.  This is the perfect mix of the yum factor and style at a great price.  In fact, maybe I should invest on a possible NYC location -- this place would be a success, as it is already rapidly proving to be in London which obviously has more than a fair share of Indian restaurants."
24/4/2012,4 star rating,"Friend recommended this place, and I've been here twice during my trips to London. I've tried the following: Mutter Panner - love the sweet peas that counter the lovely spices in the dish Black Dal - delicious (and affordable) Egg Naan Roll - ZOMG! Get this thing if you make it in time for breakfast. It's a naan bread, rolled into a taco, with two fried eggs (slightly runny) and a mysterious (but amazing) red sauce. The flavours are spectacular. The chai is great for sipping and I only wanted more. That tiny glass of chai is only  enough to get you through 1/2 the newspaper. lol. #Vegetarian review"
5/8/2012,4 star rating,"The food here was absolutely great, Indian food is usually a hit or miss for me and would say this place was very impressive. Have had a number of appetizers and entrees including the Tikas, Curry and few other entrees both meat and vegetarian. Would have given 5 stars but the only negative was that this place was crowded! I definitely suggest making a reservation otherwise you could go downstairs while waiting & grab a drink at the downstairs bar."
7/11/2012,5 star rating,"This might be my all-time favorite Indian-inspired restaurant.  Stopped here twice (Nov 2012), for lunch and the following day for a late-night post-theatre dinner.  Excellent, flavorful meals on both occasions, ample portions.  For dinner, I started off with a Mumbai-style pau bhaji, a vegetable curry (bhaji) with a toasted, buttered piece of bread (pau).  This was followed by a main course of 5 dishes: Dishoom 'slaw, a creamy kachumber salad with cabbage, cucumbers, onions and  tomato; house black daal; a South Indian chicken curry, Chicken Ruby (Ruby Murray = Cockney rhyming slang for curry); one Roomali Roti, paper-thin roti bread; and steamed Basmati rice.  It was more than I could handle, but I somehow put it all away.  To top it off, I ordered the chocolate chai."
13/11/2012,4 star rating,"The food alone would've been 5 stars. It was probably one of the best Indian food experiences I've had. And living in Toronto, I've had my share of Indian cuisine. We got the lamb samosa to start (which literally came within 5 seconds), it was spicy and flavourful. After waiting for 10 mins for a beer and water and then 40 min for food, we started to wonder what happened. So it turns out our waitress (an american accentred girl) has forgotten to put in our order. As a result, we got a round of drinks for free. I had the thumbs up flip, it was a really good whiskey mixed drink, I wanted to learn how to make it myself, very delicious. When our food finally came (50 min after we ordered the first time), it was worth the wait. We got the special, soft-shell crab curry stew with indian style potatoes and garlic nan. The curry had a very complex yet tasty flavour, nothing like what I'm used to. The soft-shell crab was unique as well, crunchy and mushy at the same time. If you are ever in the Covert Garden or Leichester Square area, this is a great spot I think for Indian food. The decor and environment is hip but the food is pretty traditional and delicious. And even just coming for the thumbs up flip cocktail is worth it. London is an amazing city, I miss it already."
31/1/2019,2 star rating,"Not as good as the hype. Food was slightly above average - maybe a 3 or 4. The chicken ruby was pretty good - sauce was silky as others described but similar to most pretty good chicken makhanis. Garlic naan was also pretty good, but for context I had garlic naan that was just as good at a whole in wall in Orlando the prior week. Chicken tikka was also ok relative to many other Indian places. Seemed reasonably priced. Service was completely inattentive - advice, don't go solo or they'll forget about you. My server was more concerned with flirting with the greeters. Some of the other servers were helpful. I didn't really understand the 30 min wait in line (though they did quote up to an hr) - there was substantial room at the bar when they seated me. Felt a bit like the velvet ropes at a club. They did bring out warm chai teas for those in line while we braved the cold. Suffice it to say, I won't be back on my next trip to London and will instead opt for one of the many local Indian spots that I've found to be just as good or better."
26/6/2015,4 star rating,"The place has quite a hype, so everyone absolutely needs to visit it it seems. A very long wait worth waiting, but only if you don't know other places to visit that also have decent Indian food without horrendous wait.  And there are, a lot of them. Staff is super nice, cheerful and makes your wait somewhat more bearable. So yays to the staff, nays to the wait. its loud and dark inside -1 star. -1 star for wait +1 for staff. So 4."
20/9/2014,4 star rating,"Things have been looking on the up and up at this place!! This was my sisters last night in Europe and this place did not disappoint. We sat down at the bar and ordered a glass of champagne, an east india gimlet and a chaijito, all three delicious! We ordered the calamari and the far far which were served along with three types of chutneys. The calamari is probably one of the best I ever had, the far far was ok - I would spend my calories on bhel puri instead. We were seated for dinner (which was right in front of the door so the cold wind would come in often), and ordered the haleem, two sides of the greens and the house daal along with a Bollybellini. All are highly recommended. We also ordered a chai and the monsoon Malabar coffee, which were amazing. These accompanied the guju chocolate dessert, which I would say to give a miss. Service was amazing and we had a great time all in all. Great night!!"

Still not as excited as others about the ambience, but the bar downstairs had me happy in a matter of 2 cocktails :)  i ordered the spicy martini and there are 5 levels of heat, of course i got the spiciest one which was delish! we had the chicken tikka and roomali roti and rice and raita.  good but not memorable for me since i can get the same thing at a cheap little place. Oooh forgot the daal. that was probably one of the highlights this time around.  Our waitress was sweet not overbearing and pushy like my last waiter."
5/8/2012,2 star rating,"I'll preface this review by saying that I should have seen the types of reviews and the amount of non-indians who reviewed this place positively, but I just was not impressed with this place. The evening started out nice with a great maitre'd, who spent some time with us talking about the new startups in the area.  Our waiter....left me wanting someone who actually respects and pays attention to his customers.   We ordered a few drinks, and honestly, why give wine in a water glass? But fine, it was okay.  Appetizers: bhel puri (actually spicy which was great), and the paneer tikka.  I didnt try the paneer tikka,. but my hubby liked it We ordered a few dishes because we had eaten earlier and had some heavy appetizers.  This is where things got interesting.  We ordered the grill chicken and the chicken curry (which were okay) and we were looking for just one more dish.  Our waiter kept trying to push even more dishes on us and when I asked him which one I should pick, he said BOTH, DUH.....UMMM I asked you for a suggestion on ONE or the OTHER?  Understand English much? We ordered dessert of pista kulfi which was tasty, and ordered the regular chai. The annoying part was that we were getting pushed out of the restaurant while we were trying to enjoy the rest of our drinks.  I do not think I'll be going to this place again. Give me some really good food plus REAL service, and i'll be there. This was not the place for me."
15/6/2017,5 star rating,The best food I've had in London hands down and I've been here for 10 days. This place has amazing flavor and the staff was extremely nice.
14/7/2010,5 star rating,"Was aware that Dishoom would be opening and I'm really glad to see that it's even better than I expected. Loved the daal and the exceptionally fresh breads. The calamari is amazing, fresh, sweet and tangy. We were also there during soft launch but thought the staff were fab, it bodes well. If they do Gola ice as takeaway I'll be haunting them, and intend to return for a sausage naan for breakfast soon too!"
12/11/2012,4 star rating,"We decided to go for curry, but didn't actually end up ordering any. Instead we got: * Far far The sauces were good, but the waitress asked us in such a way that it sounded like it was free. Not so nice when we got the bill and discovered otherwise, but it wasn't a big deal. * Garlic and Cheese Naan While tasty and crispy, the garlic naan was too hard. The cheese naan was also tasty, but was super filling and just made it seem like a grilled sandwich pancake. We probably should've ordered the classic instead. * Chole Chawal This was really nice. It came with diced red onion and a really nice sauce. Big fan of this one. * Prawn and Pomelo Salad Fresh veggies and prawn, but while not overcooked really, parts of the prawns were a bit charcoaled. The salad was good except that there was a bit too much dressing on it. * Paneer Tikka Nice and firm. Fresh veggies used too without overcooking. * Cinnamon Ice Cream Great stuff! Had a great flavour and it was creamy but not too much, so it was still nice and light. The only big downside for us was how noisy it was. I kept having to shout for my partner to hear me over all the noise. The service was good, and the food is not expensive."

4/6/2015,4 star rating,I usually don't like 'typical Indian' restaurants since I find them too greasy and heavy but Dishoom is a great contemporary take on classic Mumbai themed dishes. Fun for groups with a lively ambience I have been at least 4 times over the past year.
13/11/2015,5 star rating,Probably one of the best dinners I've been too. Found a new love for curry through the small sharing bowls. Each bowl was delicious and different. We had to wait an hour til a table but spent it downstairs at the bar. Lovely evening with the gf and her mother (which is never easy.)
1/6/2017,5 star rating,Really enjoyed this place. I got the chicken ruby and it was very good. Not too spicy but very good flavor. Make sure you get the garlic naan as well. I would love to go back and try even more next time.

Unfortunately the Management had not reserved a booth for me as I had requested when making the table reservation online...and all the booths were taken when we arrived at Dishoom.  However, the Management soon found us a table! The meal, atmosphere and service were very good, and  a great time was had by all :-)"
15/3/2015,5 star rating,The lively atmosphere and delicious food and drinks make for a really fun eating experience. If you aren't familiar with Indian food just ask the waiter for recommendations and they are more than willing to help out. You can't go wrong with dahl and coconut rice

6/7/2010,4 star rating,"We went for a preview evening here tonight. It has a cool Mumbai (Bombay) Cafe vibe. We had a super friendly and helpful waitress called Maya, who made some interesting suggestions (Dishoom Chicken Tikka and Dishoom Calamari). The owners Amar and Shamil also welcomed us to the establishment and spoke to us about the design of the place / significance of the photos. They even had a replica of VT station's clock! (VT Station is the main railway station in Bombay based on the original St Pancras station.) Would recommend you trying the Grilled Masala Prawns, and the Ruby Murray (special of the day - meat and veg options available). We had the Chicken Newabi - a lovely coconut based curry with spices. Fragrant but not pungent. Yummy Lamb Biryani, just like the parents make - but beware as it is quite pungent for those who are not used to spices / heat. Also, soft garlic butter naans went down a treat. Save room for desserts!!! The chocolate fondant, and Malai and Mango Kulfis were gorgeous. The perfect way to end a meal. Went away happy with a full tummy. Friendly staff and a great place to relax if in the area. Will definitely be going back!!! :-)"
21/11/2010,4 star rating,"For the full post and photos please refer to hungryinlondon.com/2010/… The good thing about food blogging I find is not only that fact that I can eat out all the time and call it research, but also that I have met lovely and interesting people through it. So I caught up with my favourite blogging friends LoveLeluu and The Happiness Project London at Dishoom. All three of us wanted to try this so called 'Bombay cafe' which opened earlier this year in Covent Garden as we were possibly the only people left in London who had never been there before. Dishoom is fantastic place modeled after the original Bombay cafes in India which were opened by Persian immigrants in the early 20th century and were an integral part of Indian city life for decades. According to the Dishoom website they are characterized by the 'distinct comfortable look of faded elegance'. Apparently there are only very few original Bombay cafes left in India, two of them are Britannia and Leopold's (really does not sound terribly Indian if you ask me). Dishoom wants to 'capture this disappearing tradition' and serves typical dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I absolutely loved the design. Starting from old Indian movie posters, black and white photos and retro advertisement to Indian newspapers, ceiling fans and and lamps hanging from the ceiling on long electrical cables (we were told they were designed after the lighting at Bombay train station) Dishoom makes you feel like you have entered another world and another period. The nice thing about the menu at Dishoom is that it is relatively short for an Indian restaurant and you can choose from a variety of very reasonably priced smallish dishes to share. We ordered so much food and most of it was very tasty. There is no clear distinction between starters and main and we received the dishes as they were ready. The Vegetable Samosas (2.90) were light and non-greasy filled with nicely seasoned, slightly spicy vegetables. They were served with 3 different chutneys, one rather spicy one, one yogurt-based one full of beautiful coriander flavour and the third with the sweet-sour flavour of tamarind. I am usually not a big fan of fish fingers but I really liked the Dishoom version (3.90) with lovely light crispy batter on the outside and tender flaky fish literally melting in my mouth within. The Spicy Lamb Chops (9.70) flavoured with oriental spices and black pepper were tender and succulent if not really that spicy. I love paneer and it therefore had to be the spicy sweet mushroom and paneer salad (6.90). A lovely fresh dish with home-made crumbly grilled paneer, grilled peppers an mushroom as well as salad leaves. The Chicken Berry Biryani (7.50) was easily the best biryani I have ever tasted. A bowl of aromatic, perfectly cooked Basmati rice infused with different spices such as cardamon and intermingled with chicken pieces and berries. The perfect winter comfort dish actually, delicious. Least successful were the Grilled Masala Prawns (8.90). The prawns were a bit overdone and didn't blow me away flavourwise either. We finished our meal with Fresh Mint Tea (1) and House Chai (1.90). I really enjoyed the mint tea while The Happiness Project London was transported back to India upon tasting the chai. The service was excellent. We got the dishes explained, told about the history behind Dishoom and were brought myriads of miniature glasses with tab water. In fact this is my only criticism  to serve tab water in tiny glasses (2 sips and it's gone) and they neither have bigger ones nor carafes. In the end it seems a bit of a waste of man power to constantly bring new glasses with water, but what do I know? By the way, you can't book at Dishoom but we easily got a table on Wednesday around 8 so just give it a try when you are in this area, I promise you, you won't regret it."
13/11/2014,5 star rating,The dishes here are on smaller side but the price is not too high.  For a party of two you should get at least 3 dishes and naan or rice.  The lamb chops and ruby chicken is to die for.  Meat super tender and all have some heat to it.  Only the fish is not spicy and that was what we ordered for out 3 years old. We ordered about 7 dishes and one garlic naan and end up having left over.  We spent $60 pound total.
13/5/2015,1 star rating,"It was my first time for me and my friend in Covent Garden. I ordered Bhel puri which was good. In mains, we ordered Lamb Biryani which I didn't like it at all. It was very dry and the rice had melted more than what it was supposed to be. I am a Biryani lover and after having heard so much about Dishoom, this wasn't the place what I expected it to be. We were sitting in the basement which was very dark than usual and way too noisy. Not a perfect place for me."

28/3/2014,4 star rating,"This is a great choice for a fun, affordable restaurant - especially when you're in a neighborhood of primarily chains. The food selection is just right - not enough to overwhelm but plenty of veg and non-veg options. It is a great place for family-style dining and even tapas, or just ordering your own meal. The waitstaff is lovely and very accommodating and even without a booking and going late on a Friday night, the wait was not too long. You can dress up or come as you are - either way you will fit in!"
21/2/2015,5 star rating,"DISHOOM!!  Quite possibly the best indian food I've after had in my life.  Dishes like Chicken Biryani and Chicken Ruby were well balanced and simply ""Brilliant"" as they would say in London!  Great samosas, chutney and raita as well!. Very easy to get to from the Tube station at Leicester Square.  There was a wait/queue outside that took about an hour on a Saturday night at 9:30pm, but it was worth it!!!  The staff was very nice and offered my pregnant wife to wait seated inside but we declined since we felt fine.  The host/hostess staff brought out chai tea and some mint hot water thing for everyone outside in queue, which was nice.  I never want to eat indian food in the US again! until next time... Dishoom!!!!!"

Sharing our memories of India. The food was really nice we ordered a combination of different dishes as we were a party of 6 and was really nice. The flavours and spices was just right for us. I was very surprised on the cheese chilli toast , how much I enjoyed it and the bowel of greens I could taste some kind of mango pickles... but really nice, i would reccommend this restaurant. The waitress made a small mistake in our order and we was offered complimentry Tea (Chai), without us even mentioning anything. Very polite and welcoming staff."

16/11/2014,4 star rating,Black daal was the best part - delicious! The lamb biryani was very dry unfortunately. Good prices and service overall but I would say the long lineup wasn't worth it. You can reserve for before 6pm though which is what I would recommend.
4/7/2017,5 star rating,The best Indian food I have ever eaten. The Ruby Chicken is fantastic as are the spicy lamb chops. Don't miss the mashed vegetable or garlic naan. And they are right about the chocolate pudding -- you will not want to share it! we waited an hour an ten minutes on line but it was well worth it.
12/7/2010,4 star rating,"London's first Bombay cafe, Dishoom brings a slice of cool Bombay to Covent Garden"" says the website and so it does. We were lucky enough to be invite to a pre-opening dry-run but you can sample their delights from Thursday - with the added bonus of 50% off during their first week. No reservations are required so get there early to avoid disappointment!!!! I can categorically say that this place will be full to bursting from the off... Dishoom advertises itself as a street cafe which are, according to my wiki research, sadly (if this restaurant is anything to go by) a dying breed. The menu is simple and varied enough without being overwhelmed with choice. The portions that come are small(ish) but don't be deceived, we only ordered a small dish and main each and were stuffed and barely touched dessert! There is an open kitchen so try and nab one of the popular booths in the bright and airy room upstairs; serving dishes such as chilli cheese toast and fish tikka, and main dishes including salads, roomali roti wraps and grilled kebabs. We were spoilt for choice with hot cumin laden lamb chops, a juicy mince meat keem pau spread on buttery bap, delicate flaky fish fingers which are perfect with the fragrant mint sauce, a hot! hot! byriani, and my favourite (and their signature dish) the melt in the mouth chicken tikka.. just beautiful. We were absolutely gutted when they accidentally sent us some prawns and then immediately took them back...they looked big and fat and juicy and the smell of coriander and lime..mmmmmm... oh well.. next time!!! Service was a bit haphazard, as you'd expect on a dry-run with frazzled nerves in the run up to an overdue opening. But it was smiley and our waitress and greeter were lovely and chatty and amazingly knowledgeable and helpful. The only supremely petty criticism I would have, and this is purely my own taste I should pint out, is that I wasn't a fan of the black daal; which tasted more like Heinz mulligatawny; I like my daal almost a warming slushy oniony, garlicky soup. And the chocolate fondant didn't sit so well with the rest of the menu though we all had ideas about how to make it more authentic: chilli said one, NO, cardamom said I. The waiter said that they were thinking of making it a chocolate and pistachio brownie.. mmm, that will go perfectly with the cinnamon ice-cream served alongside, which was just divine and I'm not especially a fan of ice-cream - it's not a real dessert to me, more of a fob-off. The gola ices were also lovely, the mango and ginger a perfect palate cleanser. Unfortunately we didn't try the chai or the cocktails, we were just too full of food and drink to even contemplate it, I'm leaving that for a revisit. They won't be waiting too long... like I said there's 50% off the first week AND they open for breakfast. oh woe is my wallet!"
20/11/2010,4 star rating,"After a week of eating boring, giant group dinners with co-workers on a work trip to London, Dishoom was a most delightful change of place. In Leicester Square, it's walkable from lots of places. The space itself is gorgeous: dark, lacquered wood, an open kitchen, and lots of shiny sparkly lights to make you feel warm and cozy. The downstairs area is enormous, so tables are pretty readily available. We went for 'girls night' -- and Dishoom is perfect for that. It is, in essence, Indian tapas. Our server gave us a quick rundown of the menu and suggested some good options for sharing. She also forewarned us that the food comes to your table as it comes out of the kitchen (pretty standard for tapas and worked out just fine, as a steady stream of dishes arrived throughout our dining experience). Food highlights: the Grilled Masala Prawns had amazing smoke and spice flavor; all of the Biryanis we had were incredibly tasty and, in a few cases, pretty spicy. I'd definitely recommend a side of raita to cool things down. And, of course, the naan was delightful. When isn't naan delightful? Desserts were super yummy, most notably the cinnamon ice cream. The only real food lowlight: the vegetable samosas were oddly bland and mushy. They also are not made on-site, as we learned when we asked if they included nuts for one of our friends with a nut allergy. The server and kitchen said they could not confirm, as they don't actually make them there. Curious. [The menu does, by the way, include an indicator of which items have nuts and which are veg, which is helpful if you have a group where some folks have dietary limitations.] Service was oddly hit and miss. When we started, our server was thoroughly attentiive. By the end, I actually had to get up and pick up our glasses of wine from the bar (which we had seen sitting there, lonely, for about 15 minutes). The bartender apologized profusely and was clearly more bent about it than we were. :) Overall, I'd go back in a heartbeat. The warm room, the yummy and wide-ranging food options, and the overall festive nature of the place makes up for whatever shortcomings we may have noticed in our visit. When we finished, we rolled out into the cold after our meal -- just the perfect level of full and pleasantly lit, with big smiles. It's definitely worth giving Dishoom a go."
10/5/2011,4 star rating,"I visited Dishoom recently after a recommendation from a friend. The food was brilliant, the chicken dish I had was very tasty, the bread and black dahl was also very very good. The choice of cocktails, whilst small, was very nice and overall I was really impressed with the quality of food, drink and ambience. Whilst the service was friendly it was a little slow but this doesn't put me off from going back or trying their new pop up restaurant on the South Bank"
11/7/2011,4 star rating,"Good food! Nothing that bad to say about this place. To be honest, I have had better Indian food in London--this seems a little more new wave-y to me, and not very authentic. That's okay though, because it's still great food. The decor is great as well!"
24/6/2012,5 star rating,"I got here about 5:30pm, right before the post-work rush, so it was much easier to get a table. Ended up sitting upstairs, which has a more open feel, but downstairs can be good if you have a larger group that can use the booth. Also glad they took credit card since I did not have any Pounds on me. I ordered the Samosas and Pau Bhaji ... delicious! Really excellent food with great wait staff. The interior decor and ambiance is what really sold me on this place."

12/3/2017,5 star rating,"Long wait so go prepared for that or make a reservation. However, the food and service is worth the wait. The review of others were accurate and recommendations good. We also ordered an amazing martini and the Bombay version of pina colada, both were excellent."
13/3/2015,4 star rating,"The food here was delicious and very reasonably priced. The inside decorum was very festive. The cocktails were on point. However, I very much doubt I will ever go back. The queue was an hour long JUST to get inside and then another forty minutes waiting at the bar for a table. It's hard to justify such a wait unless its literally the best Indian food I've ever had, which this was not. They did give us free sherry drinks and hot chai while we were waiting though."
5/6/2017,5 star rating,This is the first time I have ever publicly reviewed a restaurant. I feel so passionately about this place that I must cheer them on. I ate the lamb samosas and vegetable curry and am 100% satisfied. The service was excellent and the atmosphere is delightful and authentic. Visiting London and want a taste of the cultural variety? Definitely eat here.
30/8/2016,5 star rating,"Even with the long queue my wife and children (21 months and 9 yrs) thought it was worth the weight.  We loved the food, the service was quick, the cost was relatively decent."
15/12/2014,5 star rating,"Hands down the best Indian food I have had in my life. Everything about this place is amazing and worthy of going to again and again. The atmosphere is incredibly enjoyable and fun, and the overall feeling you get when you walk through the door is as if you walked into an elaborate party. Great service staff, and very accommodating of our reservation a few weeks out! The food is amazing...the Chicken Ruby is good enough to have twice! I'll be back next time I'm in London."
1/6/2015,4 star rating,"Breakfast is amazing here and the decor is perfect, highly enjoyed it and would recommend if you want to try something a little different for breakfast"
22/5/2015,3 star rating,"A fun and friendly place, the food was ok but i couldn't quite see what the fuss was about.. I found my food a little boring but perhaps I chose the wrong thing.. I do want to give them another shot though and try their brunch which is supposedly great, but that may be another case of over hyped!"
22/5/2015,4 star rating,"Dishoom is a great restaurant serving Indian cuisine. It's tucked away on an unassuming entrance in Shoreditch. The portion size is a little small, but the food is very tasty and the food is reasonably priced. I've heard their breakfast is really good so I'll definitely be going back for that!"
25/7/2015,5 star rating,"Excellent..  Great food, great ambience, amazing cocktails..  Queuing can be taxing though.."
14/5/2015,4 star rating,I took two friends visiting from Germany as they wanted something a bit different. There brunch menu is fantastic. I had the bacon naan!!! Was extremely yummy!
18/6/2014,5 star rating,"Loved the food, never thought the black daal could be that good! Chicken ruby had wonderful complex spices and get the roti to soak up every last drop of it. Portions aren't large, but the roti for mopping up the sauces makes up for it! I'd certainly go again! MUST MUST MUST!"
10/5/2015,5 star rating,"OH MY GOD! I was in heaven Friday!!  I LOVE Indian food, and was so hungry after a long day at work, and the Dishoom did NOT dissapoint! I had the chicken tikka masala (probably the best iv ever tasted) with garlic rice....soooo good! the sauce was amzing! i had a garlic naan and sagaloo too! I also tried something id never had before, okra fries, they were to die for! You must try them! the whole meal was delicious, the staff were friendly and great service! i will 100% return!!"
18/9/2014,4 star rating,"Fantastic Indian fusion! Had the calamari, chicken tikka roll, and mango lassi-- all so delicious and fresh. Great flavones and not too overpowering like some Indian dishes. Was subtle and very well presented. Will most definitely come back!"
31/1/2017,3 star rating,really nicely decorated and friendly staffs. the food was fine.
23/7/2010,4 star rating,"The decor is perfect. The food is hit or miss, though more hit than miss. Keema pau was okay. Pau bhaji was pretty good. The masala prawns were fantastic. The daal and desi fish fingers were very good. Paneer roomali roti roll was meh. Overall a great experience."
24/11/2010,4 star rating,"Nice place for a shopping break. I have been there three times and it seems to be consistently good. I am not too excited about the main dishes, but as they are more a Cafe than a Restaurant that's not the point. The ""tapas"" style dishes are all good. I like the squid and the Samosas in particular. Definitely get the ""Thums Up"" Coke - that's worth the visit in itself. Look it up on Wikipedia to find out what's it all about. Atmosphere is lively, but not loud. The Service was everytime very friendly."
19/8/2012,4 star rating,"I had heard of this place until the Qype event, but i will definetly be back. despite being in the heart of covent garden it really is an inexpensive place to eat. The quality of the food we had was very nice and looking at the menu it reminds me of an indian tapas bar. we started with a bombay pimms, and served Keema Pau,Bhel,Skate Cheeks after speaking to the chef (very knowledgeable and the look of a bollywood moviestar ;), we then also had Calamari and a vada (a spicy potato patty in a bun). The drinks walla also came over to speak to us and gave us a history on the drinks and out bombay pimms. The staff are very friendly and informative on their menu and history and i have no doubts in recommending this resturant and i will definetly be going back to sample some more dishes as the lamp chops sound very nice"
19/5/2016,5 star rating,"The hype is real! I ordered a lamb bun dish (forgot the name), and it was excellent.  But the main highlight (and most memorable) was the Chicken Tikka.  The chicken was juicy and moist, and the levels of flavor were so intense, I can't even describe them into words.  My mind was completely blown.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, so bonus points there too."
26/4/2013,4 star rating,"I've been wanting to try out Dishoom for ages but can never be bothered to queue. However, if you go at 10pm on a Thursday night, there is no queue! I went with a friend who had been before so left the ordering up to her. This being a good thing as I am horrible at making decisions and I would have happily ate half the menu. After putting in our order, we sat and chatted while enjoying the atmosphere and lovely aroma (which indeed made me even more hungry!). I was slightly sceptical if it would taste as good as it smelled, but my oh my, I need not to worry! We had a lamb dish, daal, calamari and roti - all of which were fantastic! I would go back for the calamari alone. Overall - lovely atmosphere, delicious food, good service and decent prices. I will definitely be back and may possibly even queue for a short while."
23/4/2017,5 star rating,"Fantastic, staff kept us entertained for the 30 mins wait in line and the additional 30 mins at the bar, food was extraordinary and well worth the wait. Would recommend to anyone."
30/6/2015,4 star rating,"Lovely - been several times, food is fab, service good and drinks are excellent. Can't wait to go again."
3/9/2016,3 star rating,"We came here based on the Yelp reviews. Being a friday evening, there was a large crowd gathered outside which is always a good sign. We didn't have reservations and we were told the wait would be an hour. However, it ended up being far shorter (maybe 30 min?) and time passed by quickly as we made small talk with other customers. They serve complimentary drink samplers which are delicious while you wait for your table. The place is extremely clean and the decor is modern eclectic, lighting is a bit too focused, like spotlights on you, rather than ambiance lighting. it gets pretty loud in the rooms but not annoyingly so. Service is very good though the busy night left the hosts a bit frantic. We started with the Far Far, a crispy appetizer with spicy sauces. Delicious and my favorite dish. A crispy treat with a nice spicy kick to it. Next came the Bada Pau, a potato mash on dinner bun, which I enjoyed as well though my wife didn't. The potato was well prepared though my wife felt that it wasn't nothing special. The Spicy Lamb Chops followed. This was the most disappointing dish for us both. The meat was overcooked which made it dry and a bit too fatty. I understand that the fat is likely left on to keep the meat moist but they still missed the mark on this one. The Black Daal, a lentil based dish, was my wife's favorite. She enjoyed the perfect creamy consistency and felt that it was seasoned perfectly. She felt that it was perfectly paired up with the Garlic Naan. On the other hand, I felt that it was lacking in flavor and was a bit too watery. The Roti was a bit too rubbery and lacking the toasted softness that is typical of a good roti. All in all, I was left disappointed while my wife was a bit less so but commented that she would return to explore the menu more."
15/4/2015,4 star rating,"Good atmosphere, good tasty food & attentive service. You do need to wait for a table unfortunately but it is definitely worth doing. I recommend the samosas and lamb chops."
10/1/2015,5 star rating,"The best Indian food in the world! Pros and outstanding: Biriyani - exquisitely spiced with subtle flavors and wonderfully tenderized meat Roti - outstanding without the traditional soaking of ghee - served very fresh, hot, and tasty! Malabar Monsoon Cappuccino - very nice twist of the Italian version Fried Okra - never looking back on French Fries again! Outstanding service! The hostess, waiters, and staff are truly interested and dedicated to their customers and recognize them for repeated service. Ambiance and decor - provides the perfect backdrop that compliments the food and service Mediocre: Naan - although traditional and well executed, a little too dense for my taste Long lines - unless dining early for breakfast, or before 5 PM for dinner, there is a long line (20 minutes or longer) - However, they serve hot chai while waiting that compensates for the inconvenience Pineapple crumble - would have preferred more pineapple and less crumble - just my preference - however, other restaurants in London (non Indian) have also served crumble with these proportions of fruit/crumble. This may reflect a regional food preparation rather than a execution flaw. For any Indian food afficiando, eating at Dishoom is a must!"
24/10/2016,4 star rating,"After reading all of the stellar reviews from various published reviews, newspapers, magazines, etc, I was really expecting a super wow experience. The staff is great and the service was very good. Be prepared to wait if you don't get in before 6 or don't have a rez. The que can move pretty quickly, but be prepared to wait. The food was tasty and the vibe is fun. I've eaten at the one in Shoreditch and Covent Garden and they are consistent. I just wouldn't say this is the best Indian food I've ever had."
3/4/2015,4 star rating,"great food, particularly good breakfast. The King's Cross location usually has less of a queue. Overall a good value experience."
19/11/2013,4 star rating,"Being from Alaska, I really enjoy a good Curry when traveling. Dishoom didn't let me down. Pleasant (clean) atmosphere and excellent choices."
22/12/2016,1 star rating,"Came here with a party of 4 just a few minutes past 10pm on a Thursday night. My family came from California and wanted to try Dishoom the entire trip. We were turned away at the door for it being ""too late"" despite the restaurant being open until 11pm. We could have even ordered take out but the door man told us to go eat somewhere else. There were 2 couples in line in front of us, it's not like we brought an army of people to feed. We went to Punjab down the street and they were very accommodating."
20/12/2016,1 star rating,"Markedly unprofessional behaviour by front of house staff on a Tuesday afternoon. Rude, dismissive, and unwilling to answer simple questions regarding wait times and availability. I will not be returning."
6/8/2014,5 star rating,"Shaheed and Lucy were just delightful and made me feel like part of their family! The food was delicious! Mutter paneer and the lady fingers with chutney were flavorful and the portions were just right. The prices were a little high, but being right in the middle of central tourist section, this was not unexpected. Will plan to return with my family!"
23/7/2014,4 star rating,"Pretty good food. Had never tried curry in the UK, so I thought to check it out since we were in Covent Garden. The chicken ruby was very good. Aside from many standard items there are a few fusion-like entrees (e.g. The memsahib's mess in the dessert menu, which were good). We didn't make a reservation at night and it was an estimated 45min wait, but were seated sooner. It would be a good idea to make reservations for dinner I think."
5/6/2016,3 star rating,I don't get the raves.  Mediocre Indian food at best.  Pretentious and definitely not worth the wait in the evenings.
6/3/2017,3 star rating,The food is really good but nothing you couldn't get at another nice Indian restaurant. I probably wouldn't que for a table again. Cool place for a group or evening out.
7/7/2014,4 star rating,All parts of our meal were amazing! The highlights were defiantly the fresh warm naan that came from the oven directly to your table and the chicken ruby! Will definitely be coming back on my next trip to London!
28/4/2015,2 star rating,"Overpriced and overrated. I've been twice and each time had ridiculous wait times; the second time being over one hour outside in the freezing cold and they didn't even have heaters or let us order from the bar, which would have made our wait less painful. Then once inside we had to wait another 20 minutes at the bar downstairs for a table. The food, while interesting, was overly salty (on both visits) and not that memorable. Highlights were the fried okra chips, the greens and the mango ice lollies. Please note that they don't serve the customary curries, this is Bombay street cuisine. All in all, this is not worth your time or money; you'll be much happier with any of the decent Indian restaurants around Euston Station at a much cheaper price, though you won't get the same atmosphere."
12/9/2010,3 star rating,"Dishoom can be quite hit or miss. When it's good, it's very very good. When it's not... well ... it's not. The things to avoid: Kulfi - Once you've eaten the real thing - this one just won't cut it. Paav Bhaaji - The bhaaji is good, but the paav is NOT. Chili cheese toast - So disappointing. How did they go wrong with cheese & chillies!? Things to definitely eat: Daal Makhni - YUM! Roomali Roti - generally excellent, although sometimes they make it crispy & ruin it. Masala Prawns - TO DIE FOR!"
15/6/2012,3 star rating,"Amazing food! We had a bit of a wait, but there is a nice bar area to order drinks and small plates. Service at the bar was excellent- bartenders were very attentive. The biggest problem arose once we were seated. Our waiter was incredibly absent and negligent. When we asked for things... Like water... He didn't bring it, and every time he walked by, he didn't even check in to see if we needed anything. The only thing that saved our experience was another waiter, who really picked up where our waiter left off. The other waiter managed to handle all his tables, and bring us water, take our wine order, and check in regularly to see if we needed anything. At the end of the meal, I was more than happy to tip, but I strongly felt the tip belonged to the other waiter- not ours. Our waiter did nothing, he clearly had other tables he favored. I used to be a waitress in the service industry, and my belief is no one is entitled to a tip, you must earn it. So, I did not leave the ""optional service charge"" on my bill, and I instead gave the tip to the waiter who actually took care of our table. I was out the door of the restaurant, when our assigned waiter chased us down to confront us as to why we didn't leave the ""optional"" tip. I was shocked, and he followed up with the manager would like to know. I should have asked to speak to the manager, or just emphasized that the tip was OPTIONAL.... But instead I went through the reasons I did not leave a tip for him, and why I gave the tip to the person who actually took care of our us. I was just in such shock- I have never been chased out of a restaurant and interrogated as to why I did not leave a tip.  That waiter spent more time chasing me out, than he did at our table the whole night. I highly recommend this restaurant for the food, and if you get seated in a section with a good server, you will have a 5 star experience!"
27/6/2014,5 star rating,"Dishoom has by far the best Indian food I've ever had, although I've never been to India. It is the 2nd best restaurant I ate at during my month long vacation in Europe. I highly recommend this place. Everything we ordered was fantastic. I wish I could eat there again."
28/8/2014,5 star rating,"Great and friendly service which is just a primer for the absolutely amazing food. Care and quality of cooking and ingredients are clearly evident not to mention the creative twists on some Indian classics like biryani and okra. As an Indian having 35 years of experience eating Indian and Pakistani food, I can say this meal was eye opening and exceptional. I may even go so far as to say my mama's cooking may have some competition. The black daal cheese naan chicken tikka okra fries and behl were all top notch as was the chicken biryani. I'm thankful for running into this place during my 4 days in London."
5/9/2013,3 star rating,"OK Indian in Covent Garden.  I expected a lot more spice here.  The food was tasty but had no kick.  What!  I want spice and there was little.  Service good and I really enjoyed their own IPA though.  In sum, I'll try another Indian restaurant the next time I'm in London."
5/2/2015,3 star rating,"It's really challenging to cue for 1 hour when outside it's freezing. Fortunately they brought us a tiny glass of Chai Latte. When we finally entered they said we had to wait for just 20 minutes but it was a lot more. The food was good but unfortunately overloaded with coriander that covered all the flavors. There was a lot of noise. I didn't find it great as a lot of friends of mine said, it was not so bad. I don't think I'll go back there to have Indian food, I'll try something else. Try Veeraswamy instead."
3/2/2017,5 star rating,"Really delicious indian tapas food!! A little on the pricier end, but for a special occasion definitely worth looking into. Just make sure to make reservations as the lines can get crazy."
2/11/2013,3 star rating,"Awesome food but bad service. The waiter overruled our order and we ended up reordering more food. They srem to be surfing on their popularity. 5 star food, 2 star service"
15/10/2013,5 star rating,"So much to try, so little time.   I visited Dishoom 3 times over 5 days!  The menu is huge and you won't have enough room for everything.  It's great for light snacks, tea, or a meal.  Everything was fantastic that we tried, except for the lamb samosas which I was wowed by.  If you try anything there, get the mahi tikka. The fish is cooked perfectly and it's melts in your mouth!  Also, get a pimm's cup.  Service is friendly and there's also free wifi."
5/6/2016,5 star rating,"We were tourists visiting London and had never had Indian cuisine.  This place blew us away.  Service is fantastic, food comes out fast and it is so so good. If you order the chicken curry make sure to order a side of rice and bread to sop up the curry sauce! This is a must-eat if you're in London!"
14/10/2016,3 star rating,"Came here for breakfast on a recent weekday, which was a nice change from the very long lines at all hours for this place. Service was great. Prices reasonable. The bacon, egg nan was the highlight. The rest was average at best. Long lines for food just aren't worth it. You'll find better and more authentic Indian elsewhere in London."
28/5/2016,5 star rating,I cannot begin to explain how incredible the food is here. My husband and I are visiting from the United States and we both agree that this is the best food that we have probably ever eaten. I am gluten-free and they had a very extensive gluten-free menu. The cocktails were interesting and added a nice bonus to the meal. Our only regret was filling up on entrées and not leaving room for dessert. We had to wait for about an hour to get a table and it was well worth the wait
25/3/2015,5 star rating,I had my birthday meal here and I couldn't fault it. The booth we had was perfect for the event - great ambience and the staff were really helpful. None of us had eaten here before so we weren't really sure what to have but they were helpful and we over ordered as we wanted to try lots. The Black House Daal is a must. I would go back just for that again. Only tip is to book in advance - I booked about a month ahead and it was definitely worth it. We all left with only good things to say
12/2/2014,5 star rating,"One of the best breakfasts I had while I was in London. Food was tasty, ambiance was sweet, and the service was great."
2/1/2017,5 star rating,"Delicious food, cool decor and lovely staff. Try to go at a less busy time though because queuing outside at this time of year isn't too much fun.."
8/1/2014,4 star rating,"My first experience with Indian food came at Dishoom based on the recommendation of our very friendly (and Indian) Harry Potter tour guide. Dishoom is located just off Leicester square in a trendy neighborhood full of restaurants. There was a wait for a table at 2pm, which I took as a good sign. Our waiter seemed to embrace the challenge of picking out appropriate dishes for first time Indian food eaters, and he did an excellent job overall. I'd say the prices were fair, I just wish we hadn't ordered quite so much food. It felt like a shame to let so much go to waste."
23/9/2016,4 star rating,Just the right choice of vegetarian dishes.
5/11/2013,4 star rating,"Went here with a large (~15) group, and the staff at Dishoom was extremely accommodating. FOOD/DRINKS: Plentiful.  We ordered an assortment of appetizers, entrees, drinks, and dessert.  Everything was delicious!  We have several vegetarians, and they certainly didn't go hungry, so if you're not into eating meat, you'll still get a great meal here. PRICE:  I don't think it's super-cheap but found it reasonable for this part of London. AMBIANCE: It was a pretty loud, upbeat scene.  Kind of on the dark side at dinnertime. SERVICE: Fantastic.  There was a small hitch around the number of beers we ordered, and one of the non-beer drinks took a little longer to come out, but I thought we had great service. Would definitely recommend this place to others!"
26/6/2016,3 star rating,"This place was so popular that I wasn't able to get dinner here, so we came back the next morning for brunch. They don't have a dairy free friendly menu, even though they have a ""dairy allergy menu."" The allergy menu highlights what doesn't have milk (mostly drinks, they don't have milk substitutions) and what can be made without milk/butter (not many of the dishes, as all the bread contains milk.) Breakfast here was just ok, for some reason they were burning incense downstairs where we were seated. They did have what looked like a smoke detector inside but no fire sprinklers."
11/12/2014,5 star rating,"Except for long queues, sipping on a beautiful cocktail whilst you wait for your table to be ready is always good, the food is amazing, not your usual Indian restaurant, this is Indian with a twist! The best Indian food I have had in town :)"
20/4/2014,5 star rating,"Authentic, delicious Indian food.  Not the typical curries, but rather some adventurous stuff.  A bit noisy.  Reservations suggested, but worth the 30 minute wait we had."
13/2/2015,5 star rating,"The breakfast was fantastic, the service was even better, thoroughly enjoyed it and have  been several times.  I would strongly recommend it to everyone I know. A sausage Breakfast Naan is the way to go."
1/7/2015,4 star rating,"Excellent spot - great food, drink, and atmosphere. Really well managed. Very crowded and no reservations for under 6 people so show up early. (KCL location). Okra fries a must!"
30/8/2016,5 star rating,"Best lamp chops on planet earth, that is all. Service and atmosphere was great - highly recommend."
13/8/2016,5 star rating,Love Dishoom. Tip is to go late afternoon before dinner around 4pm and you are likely to get a table then. Everything on the menu is amazing and the Malbec compliments the food.
31/5/2016,5 star rating,"one word: amazing... Super trendy and cool place to take someone you wish to impress, pricing is really good in relation to great service and food... Definitively on my London to-revisit list!"
6/3/2011,3 star rating,"We booked a table for three for breakfast and were first in ;-). It was a different culinary experience especially in the mornig and worth popping in.   The atmosphere was friendly and relaxed.   We ordered Full Bombay and Bombay omelette - mediocre, Bacon Naan Roll - highly recommended and had them twice. We also tasted house chai, spiced espresso, fresh mint tea and English tea were all very good. The ambience was simply... Indian. It is one of the places worth visiting while in London."
9/11/2014,5 star rating,"Made reservations, at Dishoom on Friday prior to a show around the corner at thePhoenix theatre. We probably could have been seated without a reservation however the lineup was well established when we left.     The waitstaff was exceptional! Our waitress "" Flor"" from Belgium was amazing. Really added to our dining experience.     Finally to the food!! Top notch. I enjoyed an India Pale Ale brewed especially for Dishoom and shared a half litre of the house red. Delicious! The veg samosa starter very fresh and not at all greasy as is sometimes the case with deep fried starters. From the grill we enjoyed the Masala Prawns and Chicken Tikka. Order the ""house black daal "" sauce. It is simmered for over 24 hours and you can tell! Don't miss out on the vegetable side dishes especially the ""bowl of greens. It is bursting of fresh flavour and has a warm sauce!     Although a long way to go From Canada,I will return to Dishoom when I am back in London."
10/8/2013,3 star rating,"Food is good and the portions quite generous - I liked the black dal and the chole chawal that I ordered. Both were nicely spiced and steaming hot. However, the service was a little inconsistent and quite pushy which is a turnoff."
14/5/2014,5 star rating,Amazing Indian Cuisine! So far one of our favorite places to eat out here in London. Loved the service and the food was fabulous! We will definitely come back when we're back in London.
14/1/2014,4 star rating,One of the most authentic restaurants serving Mumbai wala khana! Everything from the tea to the appetizers to the main course and dessert were innovative but true to Indian standards. Must visit. Hope they open a US location in California too!
21/2/2016,2 star rating,"I went for brunch and had the sausage naan.  It was ok, but from the queue, I kind of expected more.  Maybe dinner is better."
31/12/2015,4 star rating,"Starters and dessert were great, entrees could be better/more authentic. Kulfi was to die for!!"
30/6/2016,5 star rating,"This place is AMAZING! Just watch out for the addition tip, you don't need to pay it! When in London, do not miss this place! If only they had one in Los Angeles!"
30/9/2016,5 star rating,Just delicious. I dream about the black dahl! So fantastic to have Indian food other than the traditional high street curry house type of Indian food.
28/11/2013,5 star rating,"Excellent meal. Everything was perfectly crafted. Loved all the dishes we ordered. Okra fry as an appetizer was crisp and tangy. Rajma chawal was finger licking good. Pau bhaji took me back to the streets of Mumbai. We ordered Kulfi and masala chai to end the night of gastronomy delight. If and when I am back in London, Dishoom deserves another stop over."
7/9/2011,4 star rating,"LOVE the decor: kitsch, cute, fun. LOVE the food: piping hot, appropriately spiced, delicious, with an unusual 'Indian tapas' style of serving. HATE the service: slow, drudging, and rude. This place would be 5 stars all the way if the waitstaff didn't all look like they'd rather be picking their toenails."
16/9/2016,4 star rating,"I went to the Covent Garden restaurant downstairs was a little dark, but the menu had a good choice and the food was good"
14/9/2016,5 star rating,As someone who enjoys Indian food this is probably my current favorite restaurant in London.
5/9/2016,4 star rating,hi i love Dishoom but dont really like the queuing.  Wish they had a booking system as I often give up and go somewhere else.
23/8/2016,5 star rating,"Super delicious! Made a reservation for lunch online easily and didn't have to wait in line. It was our first time, so we tried a little of everything - curry, naan, rice. There's nothing I wouldn't recommend!"
12/5/2016,2 star rating,"It started off promising: I arrived just before the lines started to form and was seated right away. The server asked if it was my first time and if I had any allergies; I said I was vegetarian. She then went through and marked all the vegetarian options on the menu for me, which I didn't find necessary; I can read. But, it was a nice gesture, unless it was because she assumed I was illiterate for some reason. I ordered the okra fries as a starter. It came very quickly. It was a bit overcooked and some pieces were too stringy to chew. Then I waited a long, long time for her to come back and take the rest of my order. I debated just leaving, but the ambiance was nice and I was hungry. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to wave her down but she was always rushing past. After at least 10 or 15 minutes I finally got her attention and ordered the veggie curry and basmati rice. The rice was beautiful, long-grained. It's possible I have never had proper basmati rice before. Five stars if I was just rating the rice. The curry was good, but I thought of the microwave veggie curry meals I would get from Trader Joe's, which cost 20% the price and are about 90% as satisfying. After my meal, I walked out of the restaurant past a line of maybe 20 people outside and vaguely considered myself lucky to have been seated without a wait. I also wondered why they hadn't been better about checking in on me, to get me out of there faster and clear out a table, but whatever. And also, as another reviewer pointed out, only two types of curry?! In London?!?"
10/5/2016,4 star rating,"Love the decor and general ambience. In terms of the menu, you can't go too far wrong, however if you're looking for an authentic indian meal, then this is not the place (i would suggest Wembley or Southall instead). What you do get though is a modern contemporary meal with a slight twist. eg. the Chicken Berry Biryani comes to mind as well as the Naan Rolls filled with cream cheese and a tangy chutney which is great."
19/10/2016,4 star rating,"Decent place for modern indain fusion cuisine but sometimes it is a long wait. There are many other places which serve similar offerings. Nevertheless, a nice place to try once in a while."
25/7/2010,5 star rating,"This is a 5 star venue if there ever was one. Besides all the positives that i will mention below, the one thing that will make me come back here again and again is that they sell Thums-Up (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th…). I won't have to go to East Ham for a bottle again :) I heard of the newly opened Cafe Dishoom (the word is used to denote the sound made by a punch) from the numerous rave reviews, especially here at Yelp. We tried to go on friday night but we would have had to wait and we were getting late for a movie. So it was a saturday night when i first tried Dishoom out. The decor is spartan, but with a good dose of bombay in the form of bollywood posters  ... actually quite like what you would expect a cafe in Bombay to have. They serve wine in the small glasses that people in India have tea in. Their owners have said that Dishoom will serve ""street food of south Bombay with a 'London twist'"". The effect of the fusion is there for everyone to see. Since its a street food place, you won't find the curries that are the mainstay of Indian restaurants in London. In fact the only liquid dish that i observed in the menu was dal. In this respect this place seems like a lower end version of Amaya. You have to order 2-3 dishes per person. I had the lamb biryani which was fabulous. Definitely among the best that i have had in London. It wasn't served with the tasteless curry that other Indian places use as a biryani accompaniment. Instead i ordered a side of raita which went wonderfully well with the rice. I also had nan and dishoom chicken tikka. It had an extra dose of chilli and ginger and the chicken pieces were exceptionally succulent. Full marks for the kebab. For dessert i had the malai kulfi on a stick ... another quintessentially Indian preparation. The stick was rather long and so i ended up having quite a large quantity of the kulfi :) The only somewhat less than perfect aspect of the experience was that my Thums-Up was not very cold. But i am sure that this was an exception and can ignore it for the time being. Given its prime location in Covent Garden, the price cannot be very cheap. But i had my fill of drinks, food and dessert for about £25 ... i think that's reasonable. I will surely return ... several times actually :)"
30/4/2016,5 star rating,"I took my parents here when they visited London a few months ago. We tried to go pre-theatre, but the queue was too long - alas. We went back a couple days later for lunch and had the best Indian I've ever eaten. The three of us worked our way through a selection of starters and every one was full of flavour and decadent. If you can get a seat, I highly recommend it!"
2/8/2016,5 star rating,"Excellent breakfast choices - different to the usual options out there. Lovely breakfast naan rolls and kejriwall - would definitely recommend. The highlight is the chai tea though, great start to the day! Thannks for the attentive waiting staff, every meal has been a pleasure at this restaurant!"
23/7/2016,5 star rating,"Amazing food, long waits at peak times but they have great cocktails at the bar so waiting is pleasant and worth it. Quite noisy obviously as they are so busy"
6/8/2013,4 star rating,"I have been to Dishoom a couple of times and the quality of the food has been consistently high.  I first visited for brunch, when I was looking for something other than the typical American breakfast items, and the concept of an Irani Cafe in old Bombay did sound intriguing.   I really like the design and the whole concept of the restaurant, and it does seem that you are teleported back to the hay day of Bombay Cafes.  My friend complained about the noise level but I thought that added to the ambience of the place, being a bustling and busy roadside joint. Now the food - usually I am a bit skeptical of places that try to be hip and claim to sell authentic traditional food at the same time, but I think Dishoom did a pretty good job.  We have tried almost everything on the menus and all of them were good. Although here are the dishes I will order every time: any of the grills really, they were all well executed but I especially enjoyed the succulent spicy lamb chops; the masala prawns ; the chicken berry biryani; the okra fries; and the mattar paneer for vegetarians.  The naans are also pretty good.  I also like the kulfis and the chais, lovely! Recommend the brunch menus as well - as I said, a nice alternative to the normal brunch fare.  The Covent Garden location is good for bringing visitors, a lot of them request Indian food and Dishoom is a good option.  Service is also very efficient for such a busy place.  I just love the energy and noise of the place!"
17/12/2012,4 star rating,"Dishoom is a very pleasant, casual restaurant serving an interpretation of Indian street food.  The food is of a high quality, the portions generous and the prices fair.  Unlike other places that serve ""tapas portions"" you actually can get full at Dishoom.   I greatly enjoyed the chicken roll with mint sauce and the lamb chops.  I've also had the breakfast here and enjoyed the breakfast rolls. A top-notch place that is also a lot of fun."
7/8/2015,4 star rating,"Nice place for a quick breakfast. I want for one of their famous naan rolls. They say the naan is cooked to order but mine wasn't at all warm compared what you would expect if it was fresh out of the oven. However, saying that it still tasted amazing. The sauces are the stars and really bring it all together. Eggs perfectly cooked with the yolk still runny. The sausage however is just one small chipolata which is a bit of a downer but anything larger probably wouldn't work. Prices are reasonable for what you get. (Visit - 26/02/2015 Breakfast)"
26/11/2013,5 star rating,Came to London for a business trip and I had to have Indian food.  I don't eat Indian food often but the dishes were delicious and I loved the chicken curry.  Glad I stopped by you won't regret it.
5/4/2016,4 star rating,Went here last night with some colleagues. We made reservations so were quickly seated.  Unfortunately my colleagues were not interested in ordering a lot of things to share so we each chose our own items. We did get the Behl as an appetizer which was good. I got the Ruby Paneer and it was very good. The atmosphere was very nice and the prices were very reasonable!
13/1/2015,4 star rating,"One of the restaurant in London which you will see a (very) long queue outside the restaurant everyday (no kidding!).. Get down here early if you have party of less than 6, as you can't book a table for smaller group. We arrived at 6pm with a waiting time of 1 hour 20 minutes (wow!). Anywho, since this is our second attempt we agreed to wait and was let in to the bar downstairs.  Nice decoration and interesting cocktail and non alcohol list. I tried the rose and cardamom lassi n it is soooo good. We were offered a table at 7pm and was led to our table. Ordered few curry dishes, chicken ruby, cheese naan, garlic naan, briyani (chicken) and spicy lamb. All good especially the chicken ruby!! Tender n juicy.  Lamb in the hand was not good, as it was hard and dry (tip: need to review that recipe). Guzu mousse was my dessert but pieces of salt shaving on my mousse?? That's a bit unnecessary... and disturbed my palate. :) Oh well this restaurant definitely worth a try! Come early and enjoy the wait."
23/6/2016,4 star rating,"Great food, and yummy drinks.  The wait is quite long, and no possibility to book in advance, so make sure you have plenty of time!"
13/7/2010,5 star rating,"Wonderful food, quality ingredients, good drinks, freshly cooked food, smiley staff, knowledgeable staff, superb deep flavours and VERY reasonable and keen pricing. My highlights: Keema with hot buttered bread, cheese naan, lamb chops, black daal. My favourite Indian in the West End by far."
3/8/2010,3 star rating,"So, I am sorry to be the one writing this review but my experience at Dishoom wasn't all that great. Unfortunately so because the place has a lot of potential! Firstly, our group of 6 was squeezed into a booth for 4 people with no way of adding at least one extra chair as it would block the passage way. Note to restaurant - if you didn't have a table for 6, we would have either waited a bit longer or would have come back another day. Anyways, we decided to look beyond that and move to the food. The small plates were very good. We tried the keema pau, pau bhaji, the squid and the vegetarian and lamb samosas. I think the Keema pau and squid won hands down. So far so good. Moving on to the main course - we ordered daal makhni, seekh kebab, saag paneer, chicken tikka, a chicken tikka roll and naans and roomali roti. The dal was excellent (most Indian restaurants in London don't serve dal makhni), the seekh kebabs were some of the best I've eaten in London, the saag paneer was good and this is the first Indian restaurant in London where I've eaten roomali rotis. However, I can't comment on the chicken tikka or the naans because by the time I ate those - they were cold. Why, you may ask? Well, it so happened that this restaurant is based on a ""we'll bring it as it's ready concept"". In case you've eaten Indian food before, you'll quickly realize that you need the daal, vegetables and naan all together, in order to enjoy the meal. Secondly, the ordering system (handheld palms or something), was broken that night. So there must have been quite a bit of commotion in the kitchen. And our order got lost. So while we received the starters very quickly, it took almost 60minutes for all the dishes of the main course to arrive - and hence, the naan that arrived in the beginning was cold 45 minutes later. And in all this, we were completely ignored by the staff - to the extent of walking past our table and looking the other way! The restaurant owner did come to our table to apologize profusely and gave us a 50% discount on the bill and free dessert (try the gola). But having said that - this kind of service was a big risk to take, especially in an area where there are 10 Indian restaurants in a 2mile radius! Would I give it another chance - yes probably as the food was actually very very good. But the next time, I take my business (and my stomach) elsewhere!"
10/9/2013,3 star rating,"I'm hovering around 3.5 here. Ultimately, the food was good, ""A-OK"" as the 3 star rating states.  I lived in an Indian neighborhood in Chicago so I've had a ton of really great Indian food -- the meal at Dishoom was good, but nothing I hadn't really tasted before. The flavors and spices were great and the chutneys were especially tasty. I do admire the tikka masala wrap I got that was a great lunch option.  The selection of lassis was also nice. Service was good, attentive and friendly, but I can't understand all the hype around the restaurant. The line during the evening was out the door and down the block.  If this is the case when you walk by, keep walking, it's not worth the wait."
6/8/2013,5 star rating,"I hate to make the line any longer, but this is the best Indian food I've ever had. That said, come for lunch. The wait at dinner time was 45 min to get inside, and then 45 min for a table."
21/6/2011,5 star rating,"This Indian fusion place has all the things you could want in a night out; great dishes, delicious cocktails, and a hip atmosphere. Unfortunately it can also come with a sizeable wait if you show up at peak dinning hour. You can always do what I do and sign in for a table and head straight to the bar, works like a charm."
6/1/2013,5 star rating,"What a concept! The food here was really fabulous. Starting with the drinks: chai, lassis, to the meal - grilled chicken and fish - the coleslaw - honestly it was all perfectly executed. Not too sweet - not too salty. Chutneys were delectable. All good. The place was really beautifully decorated in my favourite style of rustic modern. Really nice server. Loved it! We need these everywhere."
30/9/2011,4 star rating,"this is a cool place to come to dinner in the covent garden area.  it's open late, has good cocktails, and is quite a scene.  it's supposed to be modeled after a bombay-style cafe, which were opened by the parsis back in the day. i believe this is one of the fewer places that serves chaat in london.  we had the vada pau, pau bhaji, samosas, bhel puri, dahl, gunpowder potatoes, naan, and raita.  the pau bhaji and gunpowder potatoes could use more seasoning, but the vada pau and dahl were very good.   the prices were pretty reasonable as well, and the ambience was really fun."
22/9/2012,5 star rating,"Best Indian restaurant in London. Me and my friends went here for an evening meal and had a thoroughly enjoyable time - friendly staff, quick service, and delicious food.  Can't ask for anything more from a Indian restaurant!"
21/5/2016,5 star rating,"We went our first night in London and enjoyed it very much! Our favourite was the Sheek Kabob (sp) and the Ruby Chicken. The spicy crispy shrimp appetizer was really good as well. Overall an excellent dinner experience! We loved every spicy bite. One my favourite Indian restaurants in London, and I'll definitely go back again."
28/9/2015,5 star rating,"This place is delicious but does not take bookings. However, you can avoid the queue if you time it correctly. I've had really good luck getting a table between 3-5pm. As others mentioned, the black dal is epic and probably the best thing on the menu. Fried okra is crispy and well-seasoned; try it with the chutney that comes free to the table. Other gems are the biryanis (I've had chicken and lamb) especially when accompanied by a side of raita. Save room for dessert as their kulfis on a stick are light and delicious."
20/6/2013,4 star rating,"Flavorful, very flavorful. And even more filling. Very good chai. Tender and tasty chicken tikka masala. Nan was pretty good, too."
14/11/2015,5 star rating,Well worth the prices. The black daal is out of this world.... Not to be missed!! Great atmosphere. Be prepared to wait.
18/7/2011,5 star rating,"This is one of those ""i wish i could give it more than 5 stars"" moment. I grew up in Bombay and this restaurant makes me nostalgic. The restaraunt is an Irani joint, down to the last little detail. Love it. Looove it. There is nothing more ""bombay"" than ""vada pav"" and ""pau bhaji"". A proper Vada Pav has 3 components (pav, vada and chutney). Dishoom makes a proper Vada Pav. I wish I could take Dishoom back with me to San Francisco."
5/11/2015,5 star rating,"We had the Chef's special (a lamb dish) and a number of the chicken dishes, and loved them all! Try to make a reservation or go early because the restaurant seems to be busy every night of the week. Will definitely go back."
5/7/2016,5 star rating,Friggin delicious!  We waited just five minutes around 4pm on a Sunday.  Everything was terrific.  Highly recommended.
5/11/2012,4 star rating,Have now been to Dishoom 3 or 4 times.  Tonight it did not dissapoint.  Excellent!
3/4/2011,4 star rating,"Found Dishoom while looking for a place to eat in Covent Garden.  Based upon other Yelpers' reviews, I went in.  It turned out to be a very nice place and the food was very good. I don't really know Indian food except for the very basics but you don't need to fear it here.   The staff was very helpful in selecting menu items.  I had Pau Bhaji (based upon a Yelper's description), a vegetable mash which was really good.  However, the bread it came with was basically a toasted hamburger bun.  I then ordered some Naan which was much better.     I also had a dish called Chicken Berry Beryani (a chicken and rice dish with some good flavor and mild heat) with an order of Raita (a yogurt sauce) which the waitress advised to balance the heat.  It worked.  Also had a sweet lemon drink called Nimbu Pani.   Really good and a very convenient location to the National Gallery, Portrait Galler, Trefalger Square and lots of other places."
5/7/2014,4 star rating,"Fantastic food!!!! The wait was long but we managed to score an outdoor table within minutes, as there was no wait for the outdoor seating. The mango lassi here is very authentic (unlike the bright artificial orange-colored ones that you usually find in Indian restaurants), and they use whole roasted fennel rather than the powder, so the flavor is really enhanced. Everything we had here was wonderful except the Roti, which was very dry and didn't add to the meal. Perhaps if we had ordered it with curry it would have tasted better. We ended the meal with chocolate chai, and were very happy campers indeed! The decor also is very cute and apparently inspired by Parsi-owned cafes in Mumbai. Service was top notch with incredibly friendly and informative waiters! Will definitely be back soon!"
5/4/2016,5 star rating,45 minute wait in the cold rain but well worth it. By far the best Indian food I've ever had.
3/4/2016,1 star rating,They make you wait in line outside. It began to rain. Get a lounge or call when a table is ready!
1/4/2016,5 star rating,"I will now dream about this Indian food until I'm next in London.  It was so so good.  I eat a lot of Indian food, and this is probably the best I have ever had.  The cocktails were also excellent and the staff was very friendly.  Highly recommend!  I hear there can be quite wait, so recommend getting there early."
30/9/2011,4 star rating,"What an awesome place!  Great vibe and excellent food.  This is the first time I have actually seen an indian restaurant make authentic Dhaba style snack dishes...the bhel puri and vada pau were awesome.  The main meal was great as well - the desserts were a bit of a let down, I had the kulfi which was the only ""indian style"" dessert I saw.  This was ok, but tasted a bit creamier than what I am used to.  All in all, this is a great place to go, one of my favorite Indian restaurants!"
22/3/2016,4 star rating,"Went there for Valentines:-) it was great. Staff is reliable and prompt. Food is fantastic for the price and very delicious. It was very lovely evening and even thou on Valentines there was no special menu or little complementary treats with desserts, we had a fantastic time. Casual place yet we made it fancy as we dressed up  and it was perfectly fine to turn up looking like a show stoppers. We will go back for sure..."
18/5/2013,4 star rating,"Delicious and unpretentious Indian food in a modern and energetic setting with a great vibe. Really enjoyed it. One star off for awkward and inconsistent service, including multiple servers not knowing what the other servers were doing."
14/5/2012,5 star rating,"I have been here loads of times. Apart from once, the service has always been fast, usually food on the table in five minutes. The beers are rubbish, but the decor is good. It is a short menu. The breakfast chapatti with sausage or bacon, with sweet chilli is a fantastic start to the day. Even the cheese and chilli on toast hits the spot. These are nice easy Indian snacks. It is frequented by many Indians so I must be right."
24/7/2015,4 star rating,"I attempted to go to Dishoom last Thursday evening around 6 - but the wait was too long (about an hour and 45 minutes).  I waited for a little bit, but essentially gave up because I didn't want to waste my time in London in line at a restaurant.  I went back on Friday around the same time, another long wait. I left again, but came back around 9pm... There was about an hour wait, but ended up only being about 45 minutes which wasn't terrible.  Definitely moves faster at night.   The food was tasty, for London standards, and the ambiance was nice; however, I may be spoiled since I'm from New York... In New York I can get great Indian food ordering from Seamless, so I'm definitely biased.  Was it worth the wait? Not really, but if you have time to kill, definitely check it out, if for nothing more than the surrounding neighborhood which is great.   And really nice of them to bring out drinks while you wait (mostly lemonade)."
22/9/2013,5 star rating,This place made me love Indian food. Fantastic drinks- we had chili martinis which were creative and very tasty. We ordered based on waiter recommendations and loved everything especially the grilled fish.
6/1/2015,5 star rating,Great design and perfect for lunch. Was lucky to arrive just in time before the crowds started to flood in. When leaving there was a queue and this is a large restaurant on two levels. Bear in mind if going downstairs you won't get mobile signal. Now back to the food and service. Service was good but I found it strange that they don't sell coke or Pepsi. Now they sell the Indian brands such and Thumbs up and Limca and also normal lemonade so why miss out the other. Very odd. Also they serve some great chutneys but nothing to go with them at the start which is also stranger as what are you supposed to do with them till your food arrives. But end of the day it's all about the food which was excellent and I will be going again. It's not spicy but extremely tasty. Took a little time to get out of the kitchen but not too bad. The portions are average but the grills are what you would expect as a starter portion  not a main course but I still think good value. Highly recommend this place. But might be worth booking prior to avoid waiting in a queue.
3/8/2010,4 star rating,"Jumping on the Dishoom bandwagon here. Had a quick bite here before going to the theatre last night and was definitely impressed. Our biryani was spicy, our special ""Ruby Murray"" was flavorful, and the price is right. Three dishes, plus an order of naan for £20. Yes please. Add the friendly waitstaff, the central location, and the nice interior design and atmosphere, and Dishoom has a good thing going on. My husband and I both liked the semi-open kitchen so you could see the chefs at work. This is a really great addition the Covent Garden/Leicester Square area, and an especially good choice if you want a quick, tasty, and affordable bite to eat before going to the theatre or going out in the area."
25/9/2012,5 star rating,"Oh my days, you must try the chicken tikka. In addition, if the soft shell crab is available, insta-buy! We also had some tikka octopus and the dhal. Fantastically prices for the portions and quality on offer."
19/2/2014,2 star rating,"I live near Whitechapel so am surrounded by plenty of Indian places. Dishoom felt like a more fancy, more expensive and less authentic version of what's in whitechapel. The servings are small and most of the dishes weren't that spicy. There was only one crab dish that was really delicious and warranted the more expensive price tag. Everything else I felt I had tasted better elsewhere. The benefits of this place is that it's nicely presented and the service is good, however in my mind not really worth it. Would recommend popping into tayabbs or needos grill instead."
7/2/2014,5 star rating,"The best value for money you can get. The food is absolutely delicious and authentic. The restaurant atmosphere is great - it is always busy and buzzing. Best of all, prices are very affordable! Try to avoid peak times as there is often a line outside the restaurant at lunch and dinner times."
2/11/2015,5 star rating,"Great food, everything tasted great. Had the Chicken Ruby, perfect with rice. For dessert, try the cinnamon ice cream with chocolate pudding, very good."
27/10/2015,5 star rating,Our favorite meal in London...fun place for groups and with or without kids.  Line is always out the door at Covent garden location.  Need more dishoom!
22/8/2012,5 star rating,"Dishoom, a Bombay Cafe in London with an array of tasty authentic indian dishes, Keema Pau, Bhel, Calamari, Biriyani. Thumbs up to the staff as the service is quick and the atmosphere banging like the Dhol Drums in India with a trendy atmosphere."
17/10/2015,4 star rating,"Not being a fan of Indian food, I tried Dishoom as a NY transplant for my first Indian restaurant experience and now I want more! Service was excellent. Although there was a long line, we were seated quickly on the ground floor which had a great ambience. We ordered the roomali roti, garlic naan, chicken ruby, pau bhaji, and chilli cheese toast. All dishes are very affordable and quite tasty! I will be back for more!"
18/3/2011,4 star rating,"i used to live just up the street and went there a lot. like my boyfriend and i had a table that we always sat at. it just feels good. they're going for a whole lazy bombay cafe feel, and man, did they get the nail on the head. come in on an afternoon, and relax, while you eat super yummy food and drink amazing chai. look at all the brick a brak on the walls and watch the fans turn. the naked light bulbs, with all their black cables snaking their way around the ceiling. the slight hiss and bang from the open kitchen. at night the energy goes up an notch and everything becomes edgy and slick at the same time. and the chai. i love chai. and theirs goes down a treat. the service is still getting there. not quite tops, but dont be in a rush when you go, and it should be fine. be on an Indian time line."
14/10/2015,4 star rating,"Went to the one in Covent Garden - loved everything I ate (curry, naan, the appetizer which resembled garlic bread, sweet lassi, etc.). Definitely a place to try if you're looking for some good Indian food in London! Be warned that the line gets long and if you go at a peak hour, don't be surprised that there's a line out the door. I've gone for late lunch/early dinner (between 3-4:30), which I hear is usually a good time to go."
26/7/2013,4 star rating,"Delicious and interesting Indian food, was definitely impressed.  They had a lot of unique dishes and not a lot of your typical curries.  Service was very good.  I liked the modern and classy interior, especially after eating at a really dingy pub for lunch.  My only gripes were that the portion sizes were a bit small, and it was oddly hot and stuffy inside the restaurant.  Definitely a classy place though, and would be worth a second visit!"
24/9/2015,5 star rating,"Wonderful food and great service. Don't miss the black Dahl. The chicken tikka was delicious. Come early if you can, by 5:30p there was a line down the block."
9/7/2015,5 star rating,Love this restaurant. Been here both visits to London. Great service. Indian fusion food. Delicious cocktails as well as a well thought out beer and wine list. Get there early to stand in line. No reservations are taken. But worth the wait.
20/9/2013,4 star rating,"Really good food, vibe and service! Best thing here is the roomali roti - must order this with the curries. Curries are well spiced - but not enoug variety - would like to see 2 more curry options. Starters: Pau Bhaji - excellent just like mumbai, samosas average, wouldnt bother with these, Chilli Cheese toast lovely. Cocktails are lovely too!"
11/12/2015,5 star rating,"This place is incredible and the service can't be beat. Black Dahl is fantastic, and I don't even really like lentils that much. Only downside is wait can be epic."
26/11/2015,3 star rating,"Ok, I am really giving it 3.5 stars, but that isn't an option. My 5th attempt to get in as I wasn't willing to wait 1+hrs. Came late, got in quickly. Full points for service - nice, attentive staff, even when it is busy. Decor - check. Had the ruby chicken with plain naan. Delicious. But small! I wasn't really hungry when I arrived, and wasn't that full when I left. Half point deduction. Full point deduction for the Chaijito (basically a mojito). For around £8, I don't want a glass literally full of crushed ice - top to bottom. The spaces between the ice contained about 3 mouthfuls of so-so mojito with a generous amount of fresh mint. Very disappointing in that regard. Love the ambiance, enjoyed the food, disappointed in the value. Great to try, but I won't be back (except maybe to try my luck on the brunch)."
7/4/2013,5 star rating,Loved it.  My 10 year old son who is a v. picky eater - said this is the best Indian restaurant ever and we need to come back during our visit.   What we tried..... - Far Far crisps:  excellent - Dishoom Calamari:  I do not think I have had a better calamari appetizer...mix of sweetness and spices.  Would go back just for this - Black signature daal: outstanding - Velvet chicken:  like an excellent chicken curry made at home but to perfection - Murgh Malai: good - but not outstanding - Kulfi on  a stick - the mango - excellent/pistachio ok - Nimbu Pani for our son with plain water instead of fizzy - the best as per his review. Service - excellent Price / Value - Excellent I am sure we will go back again during our 2 week visit to the UK from the US as I already want to try some of the other dishes as I write this.
4/6/2015,5 star rating,Surpassed our expectations. Turned u husband into an Indian food lover. Server was enthusiastic and helped explain the menu. Everything was delicious.
13/8/2015,5 star rating,Terrific food! Tastes incredible and reasonably priced for London. The only annoying thing was how they don't take reservations and it can get pretty busy... But definitely worth the wait!
17/8/2012,5 star rating,"Ah Dishoom! I love love Dishoom, and I can't believe it's taken a Qype event to get me to review it (bad Maggie!). Dishoom is a self-styled Bombay Cafe. The fun and relaxed atmosphere is echoed in the decor and the staff. You can't pre-book for small groups, but I've never struggled to get a seat  evenings or weekend. The waiting staff will be more than happy to talk you through the menu, which features a number of 'small plates' as well as grills and side dishes (rice, bread etc). My personal recommendations are the calamari (and everyone at the Qype event with me agreed), the Keema Pau (a spice minced lamb dish), and of you're having a curry of any description you must get one of Dishoom's amazing (and HUGE!) rotis to sop up the juices."
8/2/2015,4 star rating,The short: Ambient atmosphere and very tasty food. Good for couples and small groups.
16/8/2012,5 star rating,"Hier war die erste erste der drei Stationen unseres Qype Crawl in Covent Garden. Wir wurden vom sehr stylishen Eingangs- und Hauptraum runtergeführt, in den Keller, der besser für größere Gruppen geeignet ist. Hier sitzt man unter Rundbögen an großen Tischen auf Bänken und genießt etwas mehr Privatsphäre. Es ist zwar etwas dunkler aber dennoch irgendwie cool und schick. So kennt man indische Restaurants gar nicht! Es ist also etwas moderner hier, genauso wird auch das Essen und trinken im Dishroom ein wenig moderner interpretiert. Klassische indische Details wie Koreander oder Safran werden mit beliebten englischen Köstlichkeiten wie Pimms gemischt. Das Personal ist überzeugt von dem, was es verkauft und das merkt man. Voller begeisterung erklärte uns z.B. der Barkeeper, was alles in seinem Bombay Pimms drin ist und obwohl es danach klang, als müsse der Cocktail eigentlich nach Curry schmecken, schmeckte er sehr frisch, leicht und lecker. Auch das Essen war würzig aber nicht zu scharf. Genau richtig. Ein schönes Restaurant für alle, die es gerne etwas ausgefallener und stylisher haben. ___________________ The first of the three stations of our Covent Garden Crawl by Qype was very stylish. It's an Indian restaurant which mixes traditional food with modern and british elements. A good example would be the Bombay Pimms, which is an ordinary Pimms, pimmed with safran, coriander and other very indian ingredients. It was really tasty which was surpring to me  I thought it must taste like a curry or something. But it was fresh, delicious and just like a well spiced Pimms. The food was yummy, as well. It was not to greasy and had just the right amount of spices. To conclude:The Dishroom is a very nice, modern and stylish Indian restaurant which I absolutely recommend to all of you!"
22/8/2012,4 star rating,"So There I am, telling everyone how cool Dishoom is, and it turns out I haven't even written a review of the place! So here goes :) I've been to Dishoom a fair few times. Usually what happens is I look at the menu, give the very patient and friendly waiting staff a hard time over how I can get this stuff much cheaper in East London, with bigger portion sizes, and have a bit of banter about how they aren't allowed to change the menu or ask for things to be changed. Each time the food arrives and I shut up and eat it because it tastes so lovely. The pau bhaji is just like my mum used to make, only they are much tighter on the bread than my mum was. They give you enough bhaji for 4 bread but you only get 2. The same goes for a few more of their dishes. The bacon naan rolls are quite possibly the best bacon based product I have ever eaten. The chai is lovely. And they have this Bombay mojito thing that is really nice and refreshing. So, I'd give this place 5 stars except for the following: 1. The menu items can't really be customised 2. Portion sizes are really tight for the price you pay 3. The bar is downstairs and really dark. It would be much nicer if it was upstairs and the dining area was downstairs (and a bit brighter). But it's a great place  you should try it. And try their new branch in Shoreditch too because it'll be better :)"

5/8/2015,5 star rating,Possibly the best Indian food I have ever eaten. Thanks to my client who recommended it!
5/11/2015,4 star rating,"Going to Dishoom is a special experience, different to going to your local Indian restaurant. The feel of the place is amazing, their drinks menu expansive. But in sone ways, it doesn't provide quite the same quiet joy that your local Indian might. Especially on vegetarian food, I find it a little lacking, the dishes not quite as good as I'd been hoping for."
31/7/2015,5 star rating,"Loved it.  Waited about an hour total and we got there at 5:30.  Probably 40 minutes before getting inside to bar for another 20 mins but the time went fast.  Food...absolutely delicious.  Packed and layered with flavors.  Wished the spicy lamb chops were a touch less spicy.  Too spicy for me and I'm from Texas.  Sure others wouldn't have too many problems but I was sweating.  Tried pretty much everything on the menu it seemed including chicken tikka, okra fries, garlic naan, lamb samosas, sheekh kabob and chocolate mousse.  Everything fabulous.  Would definitely return.  Tariff pretty steep but not for London.  3 for food plus drinks for 100 pound not counting service."
21/8/2011,3 star rating,A different spin on Indian food where your meal isn't based on our typical curry dishes.  We had a number of grilled plates that were nice but the food didn't really blow me away.  There was a black dhal curry that was pretty interesting though.  The bar downstairs is also a little too cramped.
30/10/2013,5 star rating,food was fantastic! Pick and choose and share with friends. highly recommended. Will be going again soon
29/10/2015,4 star rating,"A bit of a wait, but worth it.  The staff was very pleasant throughout our wait and gave us frequent updates on our table.  Good cocktails and food, as well."
27/10/2015,5 star rating,"Hands down the best meal I've had in London. Every dish was excellent, full of flavor and highly authentic. Although we had to wait to get in, it was well worth it!"

18/5/2012,2 star rating,"Dishoom was recommended by a friend (we're both Indian) who has lived in London for several years.  She has a great eye for design, but it worried me a little that she only talked about the design, not the food.  So Dishoom's concept -- the Bombay cafe shtick -- had me a little apprehensive from the first. Our waitperson did not help.  She seemed in a huge hurry to get us through dinner, to the point where my (very polite) friend actually asked her if she could back off a little.  At that point she probably realized her tip was under threat, and became almost overly sweet.  I could have done without either. On to the food. We're both vegetarians, and a vegetarian mulligatawny (soup) is hard to find, so we started with that and with a pau bhaji.  The soup was decent.  The pau bhaji was actually disappointing, lacking some particular spice element that I couldn't pinpoint but which stood out by its absence. For mains, we had the house black daal and mattar paneer.  The mattar paneer was decent but unexceptional.  The daal was the standout dish of the night: the menu calls it their ""slow-cooked signature daal"", and it was worthy of the appellation.  It wasn't exceptional in a must-have-it-again way, but it was genuinely good (and filling). Afterwards, she had a chai (which was good).  I had the pistachio kulfi on a stick, which was the first item to bring a nostalgic smile to my lips, served as it was in a glass tumbler in authentic fashion. Overall, for the price, service, and food quality, I was pretty disappointed.  Maybe the non-veg food is far better, or maybe it's really for hipsters to look and be seen, not so much to eat. Oh, and I can't help but add: one of their ""authentic"" touches was a daily board with something in Hindi written on it.  I forget what they'd written, but it was misspelled.  It seemed to about sum up my food experience."
2/8/2010,5 star rating,"As a freelancer focused on food and drink, I hit a lot of new restaurants and bars. I'm usually pretty pleased with what I see sprouting up in our city's food-and-drink-scape, but rarely blown away. Then, a concept that's interesting, inspired and delicious comes along. Yeah, I really like Dishoom. Dishoom is an idealized version of an old school Bombay cafe. Decidedly stuck in mid century India without any pesky cobwebs and doing a fine job at staying just this side of kitsch, it's a themed restaurant that Londonist can imagine visiting time and time again. But not just for the distilled Bombay ambience. The food here is to savour. Dishoom's squid and prawn dishes tantalizes something fierce last night. And their green chilli cheese toast is scrummy (think Asian rarebit). The morning menu pleases immensely as well: best cuppa chai you're apt to find in town (or around Leicester Square anyway), awesome but not overwhelmingly lengthy list of items, decent prices, friendly service, comfy booths  and lots of yummies! Indeed, I reckon a reasonable facsimile of happiness is a sausage naan roll with chilli jam and coriander. And a delicious breakfast lassi is filling enough to last most people until lunch.es they serve breakfast, and bacon naan rolls with chilli jam and coriander seem like just the way to start a Central London morning on the go. And one or three of Dishoom's chilli martinis could be a splendid way to end it. Yay."
26/1/2011,5 star rating,"Very ""innovative"" menu and wonderful ambience. Service is great as well. I wish more Indian restaurants were like this!"
7/5/2011,4 star rating,"I only had breakfast, but am looking forward to trying their other offerings. We tried the bacon naan roll with chili jam.  It is a delicious mix of sweet and savory in a delicious toasted naan.  Such a deal at 3.50.  Decent coffee. Very cool interior space and atmosphere."
22/12/2011,4 star rating,"People seem to have varying opinions about the service here, and the authenticity of the place, but to me that's all totally peripheral to the 2 core points of what makes Dishoom utterly, utterly amazing: 1) Chai 2) BACON NAAN ROLLS After visiting the seemingly neverending parade of high street coffee chains that claim to offer chai (but actually send you packing with a pint of hot milk with some disgusting syrup stirred into it), or places that'll try to sell you a cup from gourmet tea bags with the best of intentions, it's an absolute pleasure to visit somewhere that makes it properly. I've no idea what properly is, but it seems like they've been stirring a cauldron of the stuff out the back for hours, sweetening it up and straining it through cloth at the point of pouring so you don't wind up with any spice chunks in it. The sort of spiciness that after 3 or 4 sips leaves you wondering if it's meant to make your face go like that, or if you're possibly allergic to one of the ingredients. Fantastic stuff! And the bacon naan rolls. Whoever invented that needs some sort of national recognition. What could be better?! Freshly made naan bread. Chutneys & some indian stuff. And sweeeeet, nourishing bacon. I suppose I can make this admission here among this tiny circle of close friends  Dishoom bacon naan rolls are the only thing I will ever refer to as Indian Street Food, because the second time I ever had one I didn't realise they'd cut it in half for me, and I dropped half of it on the ground  and it was SO good that I invoked the 3-second rule. Authentic street food indeed. Oh, I shouldn't have written this. Now I really, really want one."
6/7/2012,3 star rating,"I wanted to like this place and give it a higher rating but based on the food we got, I couldn't do that. I have read that cooking is hit or miss here and maybe we just ended up on a miss day. The chicken curry was pretty bland, the saag was dry and tasteless, the okra was limp and very tough and tasteless. I did like the Katchumber salad and the seek khabob was ok, the taste was good but nothing to get excited about. However, the Mango Lassi was amazingly good, crisp, cold and perfect blend of mango juice and yogurt. Overall, I thought the restaurant a bit trendy for my taste but decent."
2/8/2012,4 star rating,"I'm reviewing this on the basis of one visit, on a wet Sunday in the late afternoon. We arrived having been soaked and were warmly greeted, seated near the tandoor (the warmest place), offered towels and hot tea. A very good start. Our server was a young chap by the name of Lokesh. We explained that we were ravenous having missed lunch, and Lokesh kindly took us through how much we might have needed to order. He also explained that food arrives as it is cooked, this is a cafe not a restaurant (even though, as cafes go, this is more like a restaurant than any other cafe I've been to). Food arrived, and was delicious! Skate cheeks  lovely chunks of fish coated in spiced gram flour and flash fried and served with fenugreek and coriander with red chilli dip, tamarind, spicy tomato sauce and mint, coriander and green chilli sauce. Yum. Sheel kebab were meltingly soft, as they should be, with a satisfying bite of ginger and green chilli. Clumsily we both ended up ordering the same main dish, a lamb biryani. This arrived 'dum' style, sealed with a pastry lid. The lamb was cooked soft and the rice was nicely moist still. A good balance of spicing which was offset with a raita which we asked for as an accompaniment. Dessert was a Gola Ice, shaved ice and tamarind for that sweet/sour/savoury edge (kala khatta), kind of like a Coke might taste, Indian style. It was lovely but probably one for a very hot day rather than the soggy one we had experienced, can't criticise Dishoom for that. Cocktails (pomegranate juice, gin, martini and a hint of line juice  yum) and Nimboo Pani (lemon juice, mint, sparkling water, sugar and a hint of spice) accompanied the meal. Delicious, good service which was attentive and 'felt' rather than rehearsed. A delightful place which I'll visit again. I gather a new branch is opening soon (in Shoreditch)."
12/8/2012,4 star rating,"What a cool place! Very funky decor, from the light fixtures, to the vintage cosmetics adverts and Bollywood posters on the wall. We went around 10 p.m. on a Friday night and the joint was really jumping. Even still, we had a table within 5 minutes. I think we really lucked out on that front. The hostess was a real sweetheart =) Anyway, the food was quite good. Not the best Indian food I've ever had but memorable and pleasurable enough. The grilled lamp chops were very tender and well-plated. The roti bread was delicious. I wasn't a huge fan of the Calamari Dishoom, but my companion liked it quite a bit. All in all, I'd definitely head back in a snap."
22/3/2015,5 star rating,"So good! Highly recommend. Ambiance was fantastic, in a fun neighborhood, good service, reasonable prices, and very friendly staff. We had the veggie samosas, the dal (which was amazing!) naan- cheese and regular (each order only comes with two pieces so we had to order a couple!) raita (best I've ever had) paneer (tasty) and the spicy lamp chops.  All fantastic.  Great and interesting drinks too! We went on a Sunday night at 9:30 and there was still a wait- we took this to mean it was a very popular place.  My only complaint is that the menu is slightly limited and was missing some traditional dishes you usually find at Indian restaurants, but everything they did have was delicious and interesting."
30/8/2015,4 star rating,Great menu--so many amazing choices. Great service and super knowledgable staff. Great place to explore lots of different kinds of Indian food.
24/5/2013,5 star rating,"Wife, 2 kids & I went twice over the last week or so--once for lunch, once for dinner--and both times we got lovely food at a brisk clip. Okra fries were delicately crispy & flavorful. Black Daal, a signature dish, and the Chicken Ruby were special favorites. My Negroni with Indian spices was also delish. Noise level was high, which is fine for a fam with kids."
4/3/2015,1 star rating,The food is great but the wait is ridiculous.    Not necessarily because of the crowd.  But mainly poor management.  I was told to wait 30mins for a weekday lunch table after 1:30pm.   Ended up waiting for 45mins and still no table.
21/11/2011,2 star rating,This was OK as we got in and wasn't crowded but not the best indian food in London.
11/3/2012,4 star rating,"Great dining experience.  Our waiter was amazing, essentially ordering our entire dinner for us.  Great recommendations and was able to test about 1/3 of the menu."
22/6/2012,5 star rating,"Really excellent Indian. Beautiful space with fresh, tasty Indian - and a fun waiter who was very helpful!"
16/8/2012,4 star rating,"A classy, informal, onomatopoeically-named Indian-Indian cafe restaurant in the Bombay Cafe Farsi-Indian style of yesteryear, modernised with modern British culinary edges, such as a breakfast menu with English Breakfast tea as well as some Chai choices, and muffins to dip in your spicy lamb Kofte. Order large or small plates; breakfast, lunch or dinner items  all at once or as you like! The lightly fried squid and the skate pieces (yes really!) are wonderful as are the range of accompanying dips. The ambience is as cool and mutlicoloured as the cocktails even though the latter were a tad weak for my taste. In London, at least, this place is still unique  but not for long  their second branch will be in (yes you guessed it) Shoreditch."
3/8/2015,5 star rating,This place was the best Indian food we had in London. Don't miss this experience. Go early because there is always a line at dinner.
1/8/2015,4 star rating,"Food is delicious. Hard to beat numerous Indian restaurants in the area. Liked my paneer curry and black daal, but it wasn't anything special. Naan was amazing. The line was long and I wouldn't wait in it again."
21/9/2015,1 star rating,"This restaurant has a horrible ""line"" to get in, no reservations. The people working the line show favorites and take cash to move people up to the front of the line. WORST SERVICE I have ever had. Save your money... MUCH better restaurants in London."
20/8/2010,3 star rating,"[Non-photo Review] For full review, please see: wp.me/pwXBH-SQ  DISHOOM - NOT QUITE VA-VA-VOOM Summary:Dishoom purports to be London's first authentic Bombay Café. There is certainly some potential in the food, though based on my visits, there seemed to be issues with consistency at this early stage. It is not the type of place that would ever totally blow my socks off, but it could develop into being a good middle-of-the-road Indian restaurant with a twist. Given the time & money they are spending on their image & branding, it certainly appears as if the idea is to roll these out across the town, and the country for that matter, but only time will tell. It is certainly a pleasant space & if the present issues can be resolved, it's not a bad venue for a jovial meal if you're in the area  but nothing more than that, in my book. An interloping lunch I found out that my friend @mathildecuisine was having lunch near my office. She happened to be dining at Dishoom, an Indian restaurant on the restaurant row that Upper St Martin's Lane has suddenly become. It had just recently launched  hey, another day, another restaurant opening in London  and I figured it was a good excuse to try it. I only found out at the last minute that she was going to be joined by recently retired food blogger extraordinaire @foodieguide. I politely asked if I could crash their little party and become a lady who lunches too, in a matter of speaking of course, and was pleasantly surprised that the answer was 'yes' on such short notice. I actually used to work within about 10 seconds of the restaurant, and was slightly perturbed to see that there are now a bunch of new places sprouting up in the immediate vicinity which weren't there when I was. But I'm still only a short walk away, so it's not the end of the world. Dishoom looks attractive from outside and, given the fact that it has an all-window shell, you can easily see in to get a sense of the dining room as well. Once inside, it's all black metal, dark wood, marble and brass. It is tastefully done, and it has a nice vibe once it is full with patrons. There has been a lot of comment amongst the twitterati about the Bollywood-style pictures and mish-mash of memorabilia (the accusation being that they're of the cookie-cutter faux variety), but @kristainlondon (who is currently reinventing her virtual identity since having recently moved to Chicago) knows someone who knows the owners and apparently it is either mostly or all their own personal photos and artefacts. They must have one glamorous lady in the family, that' all I can say. Whatever you might think about the authenticity of the decor, there is definitely attention to detail (check out the female loos  not that I did of course) throughout. Anyway, I arrived to find my fair ladies already there, so we got down to the business of ordering pretty quickly. A tough call Café CrispsWe ordered a few small plates and a few mains and, being food bloggers (or at least retired ones), we were naturally going to share and make sure we tasted everything. First up was a little snack to tide us over until the proper food arrived. They were advertised as being handmade and tangy on the menu, and while I assume the former is true, the latter descriptor was definitely apt. While I started out slow (a crisp here, a crisp there), they soon became rather addictive and I felt like I was eating more than my dining companions, which was especially rude given they are both such elegant ladies. An LF FP (faux pas) to say the least. Pardone moi! The crisps came with a trio of chutneys but for some reason I opted not to sample them, so they just sat there looking pretty. Is it just me, or are other people often confused about which chutneys are supposed to go with which dishes? Oh right, so it's just me then. Trio of LassisWe did however delve into our liquid trio of lassis: mango & fennel, rose & cardamom, and a salted plain one. I had the mango & fennel lassi, which was perfectly passable, though it wasn't thick or creamy enough for me and could have had a bit more mango flavour running through it. I wasn't blown away. Dishoom CalamariThe menu informed us that the calamari would be served with zesty lime and chilli. There must have been quite a bit of sugar (or some other sweetening agent) in them as well, because it was rather sweet overall. I didn't mind this so much as I have a natural disposition toward sweet things, but while the lime and chilli were there in the background, the flavors could have been a little better balanced. That said, they were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, without the taint of rubberiness which so often blights poorly cared for calamari. Spicy Lamb ChopsWe had ordered two lamb dishes which sounded very appetizing from the menu descriptions. The first I tried was the spicy lamb chops, which were meant to be rubbed with crushed black pepper and chillies. It certainly looked like they would be"
12/12/2010,4 star rating,Tasty snack dishes. Had chicken berry biriyani and spicy tomato soup. Berry biriyani not quite that of the Britannia Restaurant in Bombay but interesting enough. Good atmosphere. Warm and buzzy.
14/12/2010,4 star rating,"Full review &photitos on thehappinessprojectlondo… I really liked Dishoom in a gushy, excited sort of way. I love Indian food at Tayyabs and in Brick Lane and Tooting like everyone else, but Dishoom is just so pretty and lovely inside and why can't Indian restaurants be funky and glamorous too? India can be an incredibly glamorous and romantic place, of Bollywood and colourful saris and love songs and chai shops. I never made it to Mumbai, but Dishoom (which is the sound made when the hero punches someone in a Bollywood film) is modelled on a Mumbai cafe and it's gorgeous inside  all newspapers and chai and low-hanging wires and lovely lighting and marble tables and a clock modelled on the one in Mumbai station. It is meant for you to wander in, grab a paper, sit and drink a chai and watch the world go by. (They also serve bhang chai and bhang lassi but I don't think these are the same as the ones I had in India which made my stay in Pushkar string out to two wonderfully lazy hazy weeks.) Anyway, it has a no reservations policy but we had no problem getting a lovely booth for 3 at 8pm last Wednesday night. And if you are more than 6 you can book the little cave booths downstairs which look like they'd be fun with a group of mates. I went on a platonic she-date with two fellow bloggers, Uyen from Fernandez & Leluu and Ute from Hungry in London and it was lovely to go along with girls who like their food as much as I do (although I had to stop Uyen from ordering half the menu). So onto the food, which I thought was fantastic. Really tasty delicious Indian food that doesn't make you want to crawl home on all fours and curl up on the sofa directly afterwards. Absolutely delicious were the succulent juicy lamb chops and the berry chicken biryani and I loved the paneer and mushroom salad. The battered fish and veggie samosas were lovely too  with some delicious chutneys which were a bit more interesting than the norm. Less successful were the chilli prawns (just a bit dull) and the lamb rolls (more like a lunchtime wrap) but we probably over-ordered (Uyen!) so this was fine. It wasn't too heavy, just deliciously spiced and interesting. And I didn't sweat profusely and go purple as is my norm with Indian food (sorry fellow diners at Tayaabs). Alongside all this food, we had rice and naan and a lovely bottle of wine and finished off with mint tea and chai and all this came to around £27 each which makes it extremely good value - glamorous in a Cinammon Club/Kitchen kind of way but without the whopping price tag. AND there was no service charge to the bill which is refreshing. Service was great although they could give the glasses of water a rest and bring a jug instead  the waiter, although lovely and happy to tell us all about Dishoom, hadn't counted on how much water I need when eating spicy food and was probably buzzing round our table a bit too much. It would be PERFECT for a date or with a group of friends. If you're looking for a bite to eat in Covent Garden, this would be my choice."
22/6/2012,5 star rating,Best in London so far. First remember - smaller plates compared to most Indian restaurants. Lamb Samosas were were 3 stars but Lamb Biryani with house Black Daal was a 5. Also had a Chicken Tikka - very good.  With 2 orders of garlic naan that was dinner for wife and I.
22/6/2015,3 star rating,"I'm in two minds about this place, I had an off putting experience trying to make the reservation and once there the waiter was a little too keen. But it's the food you want to know about right! So we went straight in for the main course, I went for the murgh chicken and it was absolutely beautiful, very tender and so tasty, went with some coleslaw and a nann and it was all lovely. The only problem was the portion size was really small and I left hungry. Next time I will get a few small plates to start with."
21/12/2014,5 star rating,Hands down the best Indian cuisine I've ever eaten. Incredible food. Nice atmosphere. Reasonable prices. Come early because there will be a wait.
21/2/2013,5 star rating,"Dishoom is a new group of slick bombay/ Irani cafes which are highly stylised with all things Indian and quirky e.g. metal cups to drink water, indian medicaments on display, old black and white Indian family photos. The service is attentive and friendly. The food is very reasonably priced, we ate like a king for £20/head. Highlights include hot sweet chai, spicy lamb chops sprinkled with pomegranate jewels, a solid chargrilled chicken, bacon nan, spicy chip butties (to try next time for carb overload). Perfect a relaxed lunch with girlfriends post covent garden shopping or for a local chilled business lunch. Ps grab a booth and relax(Covent Garden, Shoreditch branches so far) (monikasays.com )"
5/12/2014,4 star rating,"I heard the Indian food in London was great, so we decided on Dishoom for dinner and were not disappointed. Great food and service. Only taking off one star because the smallest amount of one of their oilier sauces stained my husband's coat :-/"
20/7/2010,4 star rating,"So far I've only eaten breakfast so can't comment on their curries and the like. They're bacon naan is to die for though. Salty, crisp bacon sat between a freshly tandoored flaky naan with coriander and a sweet chutney. Was it for this alone the place would have 5 stars but the sausage naan didn't work quite so well - I found the seasoning of the English banger clashed a bit with the Indian flavours. A great addition to the breakfast options in the West End though. I shall definitely be returning though, especially when they start serving these takeaway - they'll be a regular appearance in the office."
10/7/2011,4 star rating,"I have never been to Bombay. So I really do not know how a typical food outlet looks like but given that the decor is very unique. The food is good but the place is quite expensive. Coming from San Francisco, it hits me more because I generally find SF restaurants pricey but good. Being a tourist, i would still recommend this place. If not anything just for the experience. Its in a great location."
21/8/2012,4 star rating,"Lovely place.  Cool, without being pretentious; stylish without being fancy.  Great line in Parsi/Bombay in-jokes.  Good, mixed crowd, even for a late lunch on a Saturday.  Highlights included the black daal and the dishoom chicken.  Their nihari (normally slow cooked lamb shanks) was a bit of a hodge podge; not to my liking.  Attentive, helpful service that was never overbearing."
25/8/2012,4 star rating,"I had heard great things about Dishoom from many people, but had never actually got around to going myself.It took the Qype Covent Garden Crawl event for me to finally experience the place. And it was well worth the wait. Promoted as a 'Bombay Cafe'  but far more stylish a setting than the image that conjures up, we were ushered into our little 'cavern' downstairs and given a Bombay Pimms  pimms, saffron gin, ginger beer and coriander. I love Pimms and was slightly dubious as to how this would taste,, but I can assure it more than worked  it was fabulousand kicked our evening off to a great start. The head chef then came out to explain what we would be eating  a selection of dishes from their 'small plates' offer. Think Indian tapas and you will have hit the nail on the head. We had keema pau, skate cheeks koliwada and bhel  a zesty and fresh puffed rice salad with pomegranate. The keema pau was the star of the show, rich and full of flavour  only lightly spiced. But the skate cheeks were also gorgeous  tender and moist with a slightly spicy batter. Unfortunately we didn't get much time at Dishoom as we had to rush off to the next location of our 'crawl',, but what we had definitely made me thirsty (and hungry) for more  so I wil be retrning!"
14/11/2014,5 star rating,"Oh Dishoom, how I dream of your black Dahl and crunchy bhel. The reservations/host process is always somewhat of a hassle but beyond that I've had very good service and delicious food here. From the tasty variety of drinks down to the basic but delicious okra fries, I've not yet been disappointed."
16/4/2015,5 star rating,"After a recommendation from a Buzzfeed article, we came here for breakfast on a weekday, so it was pretty empty.  The bacon naan sandwich was great, as one would expect.  But, the real standout was the chai.  10/10 would come back here just for chai."
12/4/2015,4 star rating,"Great indian food. However, considered more of a casual joint than a luxurious experience such that of Veeraseamy."
9/4/2015,4 star rating,"Had The Big Bombay for breakfast here, along with something else that I can't remember. Everything was yummy (loved the grilled tomatoes on the vine), and I don't know if it was the jet lag or what but the coffee was so good. It was quiet but I ate here around 10 am on a weekday, so not sure what kind of crowd it gets outside work hours. The staff was nice and helpful and I loved the decor. Great place to check out for something tasty and a little unique."
12/12/2014,5 star rating,"We were visiting the UK from the US and with me being British I couldn't leave without having at least one Indian meal. I found this restaurant through reviews on Tripadvisor and on our last night in London cancelled a very pricy high end restaurant to go here instead, and it was a fantastic decision! The restaurant is right off Leicester Square, so really quite convenient. We went early, around 6:30pm, and there was already a queue outside, and of course we chose the windy, rainy, cold night :-) Not to worry, we decided to ""suffer"" as the restaurant was already packed, so this was a good sign, and the people in the queue were all meeting from work, so it made me feel better that it was not all tourists. They keep the system very organized, so take your name outside, and continually keep brining out drink samples for you to keep you happy and interested, a very nice touch, and then when there is room in the bar downstairs, they move you from the queue to the bar. After 25 mins we were going to the downstairs bar, and at the door downstairs the hostess greeted us by our name, again really nice and just high class giving it all the touches diners like. We ordered a drink and an appetizer and by the time we had finished our buzzer was flashing to let us know our table was ready, but again, this restaurant is so well run, the hostess beat us to it by coming to us to take us to our table. We didn't have to settle our bill downstairs, they transfer it to your dining room table, again a nice touch. Our server, Lucie, was friendly, professional and knew the menu inside out. She kindly explained the menu to us and then asked if we wanted a few minutes to look it over, which we did. We ordered a lot, as we wanted to try a bunch of stuff - vegetable samosas - we had these in the bar downstairs. The pastry was perfectly crispy and the inside was nicely spiced. Really, really nice. At the table we ordered spicy lamb chops - nicely cooked, three small chops on the plate that were very well presented and tasted gorgeous. Lots of meat on them. Perfect size. Black House Daal - Mmmmmmmm perfect creamy texture and perfect flavourings. So good. Chicken Ruby - OMG! Creamy, lightly spiced, lots of big chucks of chicken. Perfect! Haleem is their signature dish but my husband and I didn't really like this one. It wasn't horrible, just didn't stand up to everything else on the table. Side of greens - the vegetables were steamed and chilli and lime juice sprinkled over. Very, very tasty and fresh. Also, of course, and order of garlic naan. Like I said, we ordered a lot, and we were glad we did. Wish we had been in a position to be able to take home all the leftovers, because at breakfast the next day I was certainly thinking about it again. The service in this restaurant in fantastic. Lucie never stopped running around and was on top of everything. All other servers were also helping on all other tables and not just their own. The manager was busting her butt too running around and was visiting every table to make sure everything was ok. We were staying at the Cavendish Hotel down the road on Jermyn St, and they need to take some lessons from this restaurant on service!!! Absolutely outstanding from the queue at the front door to leaving without our leftovers :-( Wish we had gone earlier in the week as we would have loved to have gone again, even if just for breakfast or lunch. The ambience is lively, the pictures on the walls seem to all be of old Bombay, either ad's, actresses, films etc., and the lighting is trendy and awesome and fits the space well. Don't miss this restaurant and take the time to wait in the queue outside, it is SO worth it."
5/3/2015,4 star rating,"Indeed the food was excellent, service nice but I found the place somehow not fully cleaned and noisy. After looking at this restaurant many times but did not go because of the queue, I finally found space a Thursday afternoon for a late lunch. Good value, I will surely be back."
7/5/2015,4 star rating,"Having been to Dishoom in Shoreditch we had high hopes already- it didn't disappoint. Everything was great, especially as we came for my birthday and the service was spot on. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure to suggest new things we hadn't tried. He was very accommodating (unfortunately I don't know his name). I especially loved the Bombay Colada, it's delicious. Definitely recommend!"
19/5/2014,3 star rating,the good - decor is beautiful. bathroom has fun indian toiletries to look at. the soap dispenser is something i have never seen before. host staff was very friendly and was able to seat us immediately without a reservation. the bad - portions are rather small but tasty. ruby chicken sauce tasted kind of like chef boyardee sauce (maybe this is what real indian food is supposed to taste like?) the ugly - waitress was a bit rough. not out-right rude but didn't seem happy to be there.
12/8/2010,4 star rating,"I've been here twice since it opened and I'm sure it's going to be a regular choice. The food is very good, the calamari is a highlight, fragrant and sweet and rivals the calamari at Busuba. The breads are all very good, especially the roti. I wasn't hugely impressed with the Ruby Murray's - both have been a bit bland on each visit. The sausages are a must and the lamb Biryani was amongst the best I'd ever had. The staff are great, very friendly. The food comes incredibly quickly so it's not somewhere you'd choose for a leisurely meal."
28/10/2010,4 star rating,"I had their 12.50 set lunch and was very impressed. Great flavours, varied ingredients, not too greasy. Excellent breads and lassi, too. And extremely friendly service."
15/3/2011,2 star rating,"It was nice. It's far from being a typical indian restaurant - delicious little portions to pick and choose from. Think Wahacca goes to Bombay. The only thing that ruined it was the service- really slow to take orders, then after the meal they turned up with 2 mango sorbets. Too bad they weren't complimentary- the staff made a massive fuss about their serving error and tried to charge us. Try it, but just be aware that nothing's on the house."
11/4/2013,3 star rating,"I loved the idea of a Bombay Café, but this did not live up to the hype. Despite having made a reservation, we waited a long time for our table. The food just isn't good enough and this in a city that isn't short of great Indian food. Dishoom is clearly a marketing concept with gimmicky food. If you love Indian food, you will be disappointed."
16/4/2015,2 star rating,i very like this place it but they very busy the service it not that very good because of to much work the workers they dont give soo much attention
31/3/2013,3 star rating,"I went here with my son on a bank holiday Friday at lunch time, so it was rather quiet at first. It started to fill up as we were leaving however, mainly with large groups of tourists. My son had been here before one weekday evening and couldn't get in. He was told there was a 90 minute wait and a minimum order of £25 per person. The staff were friendly and attentive. Maybe too quick to get your order though; I hadn't even got my menu open and the waiter was asking what we wanted. The décor and atmosphere were really nice. I liked all the little Indian touches you'd not usually see in an Indian restaurant. Such as the sign by the door explaining the rules, very funny. I also liked the lighting, up turned brandy glasses with the stem cut off hanging from chains. Some of the kitchen equipment wasn't working so there were items we couldn't order. We both opted for the Keema Frankie, a spiced minced lamb wrap at £6.90. It was a good size, very mild but flavoursome. A good choice. I then had the Gunpowder Potatoes. Shallow fried fluffy potatoes gently seasoned with herbs and spices and chopped spring onions at £5.50. The portion was enough for two to share and was very moreish. My son had the the Pau Bhaji. A dish of mashed vegetables with a buttered pau bun at £3.90. It was fresh, light and delicious and again enough for two to share. He followed this with a Bombay Floater. Chocolate ice-cream floating in a tall glass of thums up (cola). Thums up is an Indian cola made by the coca cola company and is quite different from normal coke. Great stuff at £3.70. I chose the Green Darjeeling Tea at £2.20 a pot. This was really lovely and a great end to the meal. The pot was huge but only filled with enough water for three full cups. It was very refreshing though. To round it off we had a Malai Kulfi £2.90, small but good with a caramel taste and a Pineapple and black pepper crumble which was said to be very good at £5.20. Total for the meal: £41.85 I did like this place and would certainly go back again soon. I would have given more points, but I didn't because you couldn't choose how hot or mild you wanted each dish and the tables were so close to each other you felt like you were wedged between the tables with no room to move. It also irritated me that people were using chairs for their lap tops. Once we'd paid the bill the staff tended to ignore you and didn't reply when we said 'Goodbye'. What I did like was the food, it was not the usual Indian fayre dished up in most restaurants and that made a big difference to me. The menu felt like a sheet from a newspaper which liked too. There were other dishes that caught my eye too, that's why I'd like to go back."
22/3/2015,4 star rating,"had to wait a while for a table, but apart from that the food and serivce was good!"
24/3/2014,5 star rating,"Not a single complaint! The wait was about 30 min on a Monday night but was absolutely worth it. My girlfriends and I headed down to the bar and were served cocktails by very adorable and accommodating servers. We were even offered a surprise drink that was made-to-order specifically for my friend. Once we were seated, the waitress was perfect. She was very energetic and steered us toward her favorite dishes, all of which were incredibly delicious. We ordered the far far, crisps that were buttery and spicy great dipped in the green sauce! We had chicken tikki that was absolutely amazing, garlic naan (mmmm!), the house black daal (that was seriously the best sauce any of us have had), and the chefs special lamb dish--can't be beat. Overall, 5 stars for every aspect. Would love for this to be a regular dinner place, but we're from the States so this will have to be added to the list of places we recommend for our friends to visit on future trips! Cheers!"
25/4/2014,5 star rating,"Delicous food and cocktails.  Reasonable prices.  Really nice atmosphere.  Very friendly staff.  Only downside is the long lines, but that's probably because it's so reasonably priced.  Went back several times on my 3 month London stint."
2/12/2012,4 star rating,Adorable corner for a nice Indian dinner. Super friendly staff will make you feel at home. The decoration is very cosy. Definitely one of my favorites for a informal dinner.
30/8/2011,5 star rating,Amazing food and really good value. The atmosphere is friendly without being over bearing. Would highly recommend
11/6/2012,4 star rating,"This place is worth visiting for the unique ambience and the filling breakfast dishes. My hubby had the Full Bombay and I had the Bombay Omelette. I tried both dishes and I liked the preparation of both eggs, with a slight preference for what I ordered. The omelette for the Full Bombay is slightly spicier. We both didn't like the Cumberland sausage in this combo though. I'd also recommend the Chocolate Chai over the regular Chai."
4/6/2013,3 star rating,"Dishoom is competent but not a place we'd wait an hour for a seat or go out of our way for dinner.  The chicken tikka was very good but otherwise, the dahl and special soft shell crab curry were just ok.  So overall, I give it 3 stars."
27/10/2013,4 star rating,"On the bucket list on a hop over the pond was a visit to an Indian Restaurant in London. Considering I am not actually a huge fan of Indian food, I reconsidered this foodie goal -my experience at Dishoom completely changed my opinion. This place is incredibly lively; we arrived on a Saturday night at Covant Garden at 6pm to find an hour and a half wait for four people. Surprise! After picking up the free wi-fi, so huge for a traveler, our dining companions had scored a seat and cocktails at the basement bar. The cocktail lounge is worth a visit; it's like a speakeasy with Bollywood music with fun bevvies like the Chai Spice Mojito. The food was family style and loved each bit! Now, it's about as modern as you can get; and our table with a peanut allergy, garlic allergy, vegetarian, and me, the most picky human on earth, still left us full with delight. We ordered a hodge podge of cheese filled naan, grilled prawns (my favorite), dika (black sauce uniquie to dishoom) and curry-spiced okra fries. My southern soul was at home. We switched up to wine and continued the conversation throughout the night with coffee and amaretto and enjoyed the bustling scene the first night of London."
29/5/2012,4 star rating,"Really like this place. Have been for brunch a couple of times and the bacon naan is amazing. Came for dinner on my birthday and unfortunately it took a bit of time to get our table ready, and we were quite cramped on one of the downstairs tables. These are in little alcoves, and would be great on a colder night, but avoid if its hot out. Foodwise, all very good. The waiter suggested we order 3 dishes each, but I had more than enough food with the chicken salad and roti, ending up sharing my daal around the table. The cocktails are great value too."
24/9/2012,5 star rating,"Buzzy and stylish Dishoom aims to give punters a taste of Bombay street food and if what they serve up is typical then I can see I'm going to have to save up for that trip to Mumbai. Everything was very good indeed, with none of the same-flavour experience that you sometimes get in a high street curry house. The menu is designed for sharing, with smaller plates and larger portions and it all comes up pretty much at the same time. But they are very accommodating  you can order some smaller dishes and eat them, then order more, big or small. We were encouraged to do just this. (and we did) So we had fried skate cheeks and crispy calamari, both very differently spiced, and a keema pau (listed as a small dish but almost enough for a light meal!), lamb chops, (4), black dhal, a home-style house 'Ruby' (a chicken curry) and lamb biriani, all lovely. The black dhal was rich, creamy and soothing, the lamb chops were outstanding, tender and with a good spice hit, the chicken curry was a delight and the lamb biriani was delicate and aromatic (if just a little short on lamb). Other good things  a trio of chutneys, all fresh tasting and nothing like the dreaded 'chutney tray' with its over-sweet mango and tired kachoombar. And the bread! The roti was almost ethereally light and elastic. We had four between three of us. Plain nan was every bit as good as the one in your favourite Indian. We drank icy, refreshing lassi. The cocktails look most enticing, will definitely try them next time  and there will be a next time. We paid about £28 a head, including service, and we were stuffed. (Over-ordered, as usual, but we ate up every bit of it.)"
12/10/2012,5 star rating,"Love this restaurant. The masala chai is a must and the food is delicious. It has lots of style and character. Good for breakfast, lunch or dinner"
28/11/2013,4 star rating,"One of my favorite restaurants in London.  Very unique menu and they have some of my favorite foods from India.   The okra fries are clutch and so yummy, you can't go here and not order these.   Pav bhaji is decent along with the bhel puri.   The lamb is very flavorful and the daal is also another staple on there menu.   If your going here at night make sure to make a reservation as it can get very busy on weekends."
24/8/2013,5 star rating,"Best meal I had in London was breakfast here,  I still dream of the bacon naan roll and granola.   Sooooo good."
10/8/2010,5 star rating,"Went to celebrate my birthday dinner and had a fantastic meal. Lamb samosas, chili cheese toast, and chicken tikka were all fantastic. Even the dahl was amazing! Will be back."
27/7/2013,2 star rating,It is very loud in there. You have to yell to be heard. The food is not that great. I had chicken that wasn't fully cooked. I should have sent it back. Service is pretty good. It is clean. It wasn't totally Indian food. There were many twists that weren't that good. Such as the lamb and the chicken. I don't think I'm coming back here again.
2/1/2013,4 star rating,"Of course when you're in England, you must do as the Brits do - and eat Indian food! And, being that I am a native (both British and Indian) I needed to experience some home cooking while in my former home. I took Bob to Dishoom and it did not disappoint. The host was very friendly and we were seated right in front of the huge open kitchen, where we got to see the chefs preparing naan. We were actually really lucky as we arrived around 7:00pm and beat the rush that followed immediately after. We ordered the soft-shell crab, butter naan, tandoori prawns and the tandoori chicken. The naan was hot and fresh - that perfect balance between a little bit burnt on the outside but chewy in the middle. The shrimp were fantastic, perfectly cooked and seasoned well. The chicken was phenomenal - super tender, you literally didn't even need a fork to cut it, it just fell apart. And the soft-shell crab was their self-pronounced specialty and it was fantastic. The curry was very nice, not as spicy as I would've liked but still tasty - the only complaint I had was that it did have a bit too much coconut milk in it for me - a bit too sweet. After gorging on all that savory goodness, we also had dessert. We split the rice pudding - and it was perfection. You could really taste the vanilla and had a wonderful pudding texture. All in all, this place is very good! I am sure there are more authentic Indian establishments around London - but this is just as tasty!"
12/8/2013,4 star rating,"Amazing food, attentive friendly staff. Paneer tikka is to die for. I'll be back"
5/2/2013,5 star rating,this is probably the best Indian joint in London. The food was AMAZING and the portions were huge. We had to wait for 1 1/2 hours for our table because it was so crowded but it was FOR SURE worth the wait
12/9/2012,5 star rating,"I have often walked past this restaurant, assuming that it was an upmarket Indian restaurant run by some annoying celebrity. In retrospect I wished I had stopped. The decor is delightful, it feels homely, well thought out and classy. Downstairs you will find snug booths, whilst upstairs intimate tables. Asian newspaper prints line the walls and geometric tiles laiden the floor. However, as grand as this place feels, this is eclipsed by the quality of the food. This restaurant serves authentic Bombay food and they seem very keen on keeping things traditional, although every now and then, with a little kick! The food us down to earth, wholesome, packed with vegetables, seeds, nuts and lashing of fresh herbs and everything I have tried here has been a pure delight! Tasty, fresh and absolutely divine! It's also a good choice for the vegetarians with a lot of meat free, but equally fantastic, options I sampled the keema pau, skate cheeks koliada and the bhel. Whilst an unusual mix, which might sound not to everyone's taste, everything was fresh and tasted fantastic. I couldn't get enough if the skate cheeks and bhel. They were addictive! I also tried the Bombay pimms, a cocktail made with saffron gin, pomegranate and Ginger beer. It was wonderful. I loved every sip. I've been to some great London cocktail bars and whilst you might not expect it from what is primarily an eatery, this tops a lot of them! Plates are reasonably priced, with lots if smaller dishes which can be sampled with friends tapas style. How very social! Highly recommended I can't wait to return to try out some of their other delightful offerings."
30/6/2015,5 star rating,"I have been to the Dishoom at kings cross. It was great. This, however, was exceptional. I came with my daughters, one with a mobility disability and they were extremely accommodating. We ordered small plates, calamari and lamb samosas, they came quickly and were delicious. The chicken tikka and the lamb chops were perfectly cooked and spiced. The garlic naan and basmati rice were excellent. The cucumber onion salad was interesting and tasty. The mint tea was made fresh and the nimbu pani (a lemon, soda, sugar and salt) drink was unusual and lovely. Order the house chai, very traditional and warming. Also the chocolate mousse was a culinary masterpiece. The ambiance was pleasant, and the waitstaff were considerate and prompt. While the bill was not light, it is worth it for the experience. Evalina (?) was a great server. She was attentive but not hovering, and very helpful with spot on menu tips."
15/4/2013,4 star rating,"We went to Dishoom for the first time; we were accompanied by our family members who'd been there before and had enjoyed their experience. My wife is a vegetarian and I've acquired a taste for chicken over the last 3-4 years. We got a table immediately though it was a Saturday night. We're from the US and compared to the US restaurants, the tables were very close to each other; something we're getting used to during our Europe trip. We were greeted by a pleasant hostess who took our orders right away. The choices were limited compared to other Indian restaurants. But food arrived even before we could get comfortable in our chairs! Now that is fast, probably faster than a drive-through at McDonald's! AND the food was very well made. Tasty with the right amount of spices and cooked to the right degree. I timed an order for roti(bread) and got it in 2:10! My only critique of the food is that I would've liked the food to have been a little bit warmer. Not that it was cold but I like my food to be quite hot (temperature). Quantity was adequate (not like the typical huge American serving sizes). Price was actually less than most good Indian restaurants and dinner for 2 should be around £25-30 without alcohol. All said, a great experience. I've reduced 0.5 stars each for limited choices and the rather warm food. Otherwise this is a really good restaurant for people interested in an Indian restaurant with good ambience and tasty food."
17/2/2011,3 star rating,"Dishoom looks gorgeous, all 70 Bollywood glamour and cosy booths. Although they describe themselves as a cafe this is about as far away from Formica tabled greasy spoons as you could get. I've been to Dishoom for dinner and definately think that their strong point is the grills rather than the token curry which was quite bland on the night we went. I would also probably skip the biryani as it did not have much meat in it. I would probably go for the grilled salmon and the huge masala prawns and maybe some of the street food like the pau bhaji. Unfortunately they serve their wine in tumblers rather than wine glasses which, while authentic means the wine gets warm quite quickly. I would also definately stick with the indian desserts, the kulfi was lovely but the chocolate fondant was quite dry. Would I travel out of my way to go to Dishoom? Probably not. Is it a good safe bet if you're in the area? Definately. I will certainly be back now I've figured out which are the hits and misses on the menu."
12/5/2012,3 star rating,Good solid Indian food with a cute 50s vibe to the place but wasn't blown away by the food.  It was definitely solid but the cafe felt a little awkward and wanted more variety on the menu.
1/1/2012,5 star rating,Fun. Great food. Indian without the elephants and waitstaff in turbans.
3/6/2012,5 star rating,"Great stuff, reminds me of Dosa in sf (filmore district) but no dosa's made here.   Even home made naan.  Thanks to yelpers to help us find this!"
29/8/2013,4 star rating,"It was 85 (Fahrenheit...sorry, I'm American) and humid outside, and despite the lack of air conditioning and Bollywood posters festooning the walls, the sleek black and white decor did not sweep me away to Bombay. LA perhaps. But in LA the place would have been air conditioned. Still, I enjoyed the atmosphere, and the food, served family style in small portions to facilitate tasting, was delicious. The mango and paneer salad, the largest of the bunch, had a nice balance of salty cheese and sweet fruit. The chicken ruby was tender and rich, as was the black daal. Skate cheeks, served with a sweet chutney, were light and tender, and the bhel, a puffed rice and vegetable salad, was the perfect appetizer for that sultry summer evening. A sweet and smooth mango fennel lassi paired nicely, though I wish it had been a bit colder and more tart with a bigger hit of fennel seed. Quick and courteous service rounded out a lovely dinner."
2/2/2011,1 star rating,"Went there on 1/2/11. Food ok for western palates but I found it a bit too mild. However, the worst aspect was the service - slow, lack of attention and generally did not seem to be interested in service."

13/3/2012,1 star rating,"Wow. I had the worst experience here.  I was so excited to try this place out for brunch because I had heard great things and decided to come here on my last day in London. In my experience of living in nyc, there doesn't tend to be great ethnic food in the touristy/busy areas so I was skeptical. But I'll never know because I never got to try the food. I came here towards the end of brunch and wanted to order their version of pancakes. They were out of them, fine, I get it, no problem, but for some strange reason the waiter tried to sell me on the yogurt. Because they're both sweet? It's easy to make? Who knows. I said no, thank you. Unfortunately, there wasn't another item that stood out to me but I had already ordered a chai (since I heard it was a must-try, and from the few sips I had, it was fine). I asked if I could just get my check and a to-go cup since I figured I would try to grab my brunch elsewhere. For some reason, despite asking 3 different people this, it still had not happened 25 minutes later.  Then my waiter came over and told me to give him 5 more minutes. Really? I couldn't believe it. I've worked in a restaurant and I would never treat a customer like that. They made it so I was too late to get brunch anywhere else and put a damper on my last day in the city."
