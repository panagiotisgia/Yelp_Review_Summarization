7. ## About The Project
This project consists of two parts:

1. `Yelp Scrape Function.ipynb` - This script is used to scrape Yelp for the top 10 restaurants based on your specified food and city. The script then generates a CSV file containing metadata for the first restaurant on the list along with all its reviews.

2. `Yelp Summarize Function.ipynb` - This script reads the previously generated CSV file and creates a PDF report based on the restaurant metadata and its reviews.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository using this command:

```bash
